Ras proteins transduce signals from extracellular growth factors by cycling between inactive GDP-bound and active GTP-bound states. The exchange of GTP for GDP on RAS is regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs).

However, there are currently no effective anticancer drugs against Ras-induced cancers. Therefore, identifying the downstream effectors of the Ras signaling pathway can facilitate the development of promising novel therapeutic approaches. We previously showed that oncogenic Ras induces the expression of the receptor tyrosine kinase c-Mer proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase (MerTK) in an interleukin-1 family member NF-HEV/IL-33-dependent manner and that IL-33 and MerTK contribute to oncogenic Ras-induced cell migration. In the present study, we purified the MerTK complex from NIH-3T3 cells transformed by the expression of oncogenic Ras, H-Ras (G12V). Mass spectrometric analysis identified STK38 (also known as NDR1) as a candidate binding partner for MerTK. STK38 is a serine/threonine protein kinase that plays diverse roles in normal and cancerous cells. In addition to MerTK knockdown, STK38 knockdown effectively attenuated the H-Ras (G12V)-induced migration of NIH-3T3 cells. STK38 kinase activity is required for oncogenic Ras-induced cell migration and MerTK tyrosine phosphorylation. Furthermore, MerTK or STK38 knockdown attenuated the activation of Rac1 and Cdc42. Taken together, these results revealed a novel role for STK38 in oncogenic Ras-induced enhanced cell migration, which may be useful for developing novel therapeutic strategies targeting Ras-mutated cells.", "authors": "Ohta S; Tago K; Kasashima K; Ebina M; Tominaga K", "fulltext_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12607517/", "keywords": "Ras signaling pathway[MeSH Terms] AND mouse[MeSH Terms]", "llm_relevance_assessment": {"relevance_score": 9, "relevance_level": "High", "species_check": "The pathway is for Mus musculus (mouse), and the study uses NIH-3T3 mouse cells, ensuring species consistency.", "evidence_summary": ["We purified the MerTK complex from NIH-3T3 cells transformed by the expression of oncogenic Ras, H-Ras (G12V).", "STK38 kinase activity is required for oncogenic Ras-induced cell migration and MerTK tyrosine phosphorylation."], "reasoning": "The article directly investigates the downstream effects of oncogenic Ras signaling in mouse cells, focusing on the role of STK38 in promoting cell migration via MerTK activation.

While PCNP functions as a tumor suppressor in neuroblastoma and lung adenocarcinoma, it has been identified as a tumor promoter in ovarian cancer. However, the underlying mechanisms driving these contrasting effects remain unclear. Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) was employed to analyze relevance of PCNP expression with prognosis in HCC. To evaluate the role of PCNP in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), we analyzed the expression of PCNP in 87 HCC tissues and 80 adjacent normal tissues. Correlation between PCNP and ubiquitin-like with PHD and ring finger domains 2 (UHRF2) was transcriptionally detected, and then their effects on malignant behaviors, including proliferation, invasion, tumor formation in vitro and in vivo were evaluated. According to tissues array results, it is found that PCNP was significantly upregulated in HCC tissues, which was further confirmed in HCC cell lines by western blotting. Importantly, both the cytoplasmic and nuclear PCNP fractions were correlated with pathological grade, T staging, clinical staging and recurrence, and patients with a high level of PCNP had lower overall survival and disease-free survival and a higher recurrence rate than those with a low PCNP level, indicating that PCNP might be an independent prognostic factor for HCC patients. Functional investigations revealed that PCNP knockdown inhibited malignant behaviors, including proliferation, invasion, colony formation and tumor formation, in vitro and in vivo. Pearson correlation analysis indicated a positive association between PCNP and UHRF2, with evidence that PCNP transcriptionally upregulates UHRF2. Furthermore, ectopic overexpression of PCNP activated the ErbB3/Ras/Raf1 signaling pathway through upregulation of UHRF2. Our findings suggest that PCNP promotes HCC progression by activating the ErbB3/Ras/Raf signaling pathway through upregulation of UHRF2.

These mutations activate downstream MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways, contributing to tumor progression and resistance to therapy. Although the MEK inhibitor trametinib is used to target these pathways, its efficacy is limited in KRAS-mutant OCa due to compensatory activation of the leukemia inhibitory factor (<i>LIF</i>)/<i>LIF</i> receptor (<i>LIFR</i>) axis. In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic potential of combining trametinib with EC359, a selective <i>LIFR</i> inhibitor, in <i>Ras</i>/<i>Raf</i>-driven OCa models. EC359 significantly reduced cell viability, clonogenic survival, and induced cell death via ferroptosis in vitro.

{"id": "mmu05220", "name": "Chronic myeloid leukemia - Mus musculus (house mouse)", "description": "Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a clonal myeloproliferative disorder of a pluripotent stem cell. The natural history of CML has a triphasic clinical course comprising of an initial chronic phase (CP), which is characterized by expansion of functionally normal myeloid cells, followed by an accelerated phase (AP) and finally a more aggressive blast phase (BP), with loss of terminal differentiation capacity. On the cellular level, CML is associated with a specific chromosome abnormality, the t(9; 22) reciprocal translocation that forms the Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome. The Ph chromosome is the result of a molecular rearrangement between the c-ABL proto-oncogene on chromosome 9 and the BCR (breakpoint cluster region) gene on chromosome 22. The BCR/ABL fusion gene encodes p210 BCR/ABL, an oncoprotein, which, unlike the normal p145 c-Abl, has constitutive tyrosine kinase activity and is predominantly localized in the cytoplasm. While fusion of c-ABL and BCR is believed to be the primary cause of the chronic phase of CML, progression to blast crisis requires other molecular changes. Common secondary abnormalities include mutations in TP53, RB, and p16/INK4A, or overexpression of genes such as EVI1. Additional chromosome translocations are also observed,such as t(3;21)(q26;q22), which generates AML1-EVI1.", "genes": ["107986"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "40976411", "title": "ENO1 blockade augment ferroptosis susceptibility in TKIs-resistant CML through GPX4 autophagic degradation.", "abstract": "The introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has significantly improved the prognosis of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), however, approximately 20 % CML patients developed resistance to TKIs and lead to treatment failure. Enolase 1 (ENO1) is a critical enzyme involved in glycolysis and was found to be closely related to CML carcinogenesis. Our results indicate ENO1 expression was close correlated with drug responses and disease prognosis in CML. The chemo-resistant CML cell K562/G more relied on glycolysis for energy supply than its sensitive counterparts., Metabolomic analysis revealed that ENOblock, APIII-α4 (AP), synergized with multiple TKIs and induce ferroptosis in K562/G cells. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that GPX4 play more crucial role in sustaining chemo-resistant CML cell survival. Transcriptomic analysis and WB results revealed GPX4 autophagic degradation induced by ENO1 downregulation. AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway activated by ENO1 downregulationplayed partial role in GPX4 degradation. More importantly, the expression of ENO1 was found to be inversely correlated with that of a transmembrane protein TMEM164. TMEM164 interference would restore the GPX4 autophagic degradation and ferroptosis susceptibility induced by ENO1 downregulation. Single-cell sequence data revealed a co-expression relationship between ENO1 and GPX4, especially in CML patients with poor TKIs responses. Besides, In vivo animal experiments demonstrated that AP could cooperate with TKIs to relieve the tumor burden with tolerable safety. Taken together, this study demonstrated that ENO1 is a crucial biomarker for CML TKIs responses, and ENO1 blockade could augment TKIs sensitivity and promote the ferroptosis susceptibility in TKIs-resistant cells by ultimately inducing GPX4 autophagic degradation through AMPK/mTOR pathway and ENO1-TMEM164 interaction, which provide a potential novel target for the clinical treatment of CML.", "authors": "Hongwei P; Xintong Y; Zhiwei C; Jinfang H; Dongsheng X; Jiaqi W; Zhen L; Yue L; Xu W; Simei R; Fei L", "fulltext_url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.freeradbiomed.2025.08.055", "keywords": "Chronic myeloid leukemia[MeSH Terms] AND mouse[MeSH Terms]", "llm_relevance_assessment": {"relevance_score": 9, "relevance_level": "High", "species_check": "The pathway is in Mus musculus (mouse), and the article uses a mouse model for in vivo experiments, indicating a valid model organism for studying CML.", "evidence_summary": ["ENO1 blockade augment ferroptosis susceptibility in TKIs-resistant CML through GPX4 autophagic degradation.", "In vivo animal experiments demonstrated that AP could cooperate with TKIs to relieve the tumor burden with tolerable safety."], "reasoning": "The article directly investigates mechanisms related to CML pathogenesis, including drug resistance and metabolic reprogramming.

DOT1L loss cooperated with LSD1 inhibitors to activate tumor suppressive programs, while pharmacologic inhibition of DOT1Ls catalytic activity failed to elicit comparable effects.

However, resistance to TKIs often leads to treatment failure. Pyroptosis, a form of programmed cell death, has emerged as a promising strategy in cancer therapy due to its ability to eliminate tumor cells while stimulating antitumor immunity. Low-dose decitabine (DAC) has been shown to reverse methylation-induced silencing of the pyroptosis-related gene gasdermin E (GSDME) in some tumor cells, offering a potential new therapeutic option for CML. Herein, we propose a combination therapy using 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), a broad-spectrum chemotherapeutic agent, and low-dose DAC to induce pyroptosis in CML cells via the caspase-3/GSDME pathway. However, the nonspecific targeting of 5-FU diminishes its pyroptosis efficacy and causes off-target toxicity, highlighting the need for a targeted drug delivery system. RESULTS: In this study, we developed 5-FU@HFn nanoparticles (NPs) by loading 5-FU into the recombinant human heavy chain ferritin (HFn) nanocage through a high-temperature via the drug channels on the protein cage. The loading efficiency was approximately 50.62 ± 1.17 µg of 5-FU per mg of HFn. 5-FU@HFn NPs selectively targeted CML cells through CD71-mediated uptake, significantly enhancing the therapeutic effects of 5-FU. When combined with DAC, 5-FU@HFn NPs effectively activated pyroptosis via the caspase-3/GSDME pathway in both TKI-sensitive and TKI-resistant CML cells. In a CML mouse model, this combination therapy significantly suppressed tumorigenesis and triggered a robust antitumor immune response, facilitating the clearance of leukemic cells. Furthermore, the 5-FU@HFn NPs exhibited excellent in vivo safety.

{"id": "mmu05010", "name": "Alzheimer disease - Mus musculus (house mouse)", "description": "Alzheimer disease (AD) is a chronic disorder that slowly destroys neurons and causes serious cognitive disability. AD is associated with senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Amyloid-beta (Abeta), a major component of senile plaques, has various pathological effects on cell and organelle function. To date genetic studies have revealed four genes that may be linked to autosomal dominant or familial early onset AD (FAD). These four genes include: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1), presenilin 2 (PS2) and apolipoprotein E (ApoE). All mutations associated with APP and PS proteins can lead to an increase in the production of Abeta peptides, specfically the more amyloidogenic form, Abeta42. It was proposed that Abeta form Ca2+ permeable pores and bind to and modulate multiple synaptic proteins, including NMDAR, mGluR5 and VGCC, leading to the overfilling of neurons with calcium ions. Consequently, cellular Ca2+ disruptions will lead to neuronal apoptosis, autophagy deficits, mitochondrial abnormality, defective neurotransmission, impaired synaptic plasticity and neurodegeneration in AD. FAD-linked PS1 mutation downregulates the unfolded protein response and leads to vulnerability to ER stress.", "genes": ["100041273"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "41327376", "title": "Ceftriaxone alleviates mitochondrial damage through the inhibition of extrasynaptic NMDA receptor-mediated changes in intracellular calcium levels to improve cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 mice.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mitochondrial dysfunction and dysregulated calcium homeostasis contribute to Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. The extrasynaptic N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor (eNMDAR) plays a crucial role in calcium influx and subsequent signaling cascades. In individuals with AD, the reduced expression and function of glutamate transporter-1 (GLT-1) result in glutamate spillover from the synaptic clefts to the extrasynaptic region, thereby activating eNMDAR and inducing mitochondrial damage. Ceftriaxone (Cef) has been reported to ameliorate cognitive deficits in APPswe/PS1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice by upregulating GLT-1. This study aimed to explore whether Cef alleviates mitochondrial dysfunction to improve cognitive impairment and the roles of GLT-1 and eNMDAR, particularly the participation of eNMDAR-induced intracellular calcium signaling in this process. METHODS: C57BL/6J, APP/PS1, and GLT-1-knockdown APP/PS1 mice were used. NMDA (1 mM, 2 µL per ventricle) was injected cerebroventricularly into APP/PS1 mice once to activate eNMDAR. Cef (200 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally administered for 14 days. Cognitive function was evaluated by novel object recognition, novel location recognition and Morris water maze tests. Hippocampal mitochondrial ultrastructure was observed using transmission electron microscopy. Hippocampal mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) was detected using JC-1 staining. The expression of eNMDAR and proteins related to mitochondrial biogenesis and dynamics was evaluated by western blot. A neuron‒astrocyte coculture derived from the cerebral cortex of embryonic mice was used to evaluate the effects of Cef on eNMDAR-induced neuronal calcium influx, mitochondrial calcium accumulation and MMP loss using live-cell imaging. RESULTS: Cef treatment attenuated hippocampal mitochondrial dysfunction, including ultrastructural damage, reduced aspect ratio, dysregulation of MMP, impaired biogenesis and dynamics, and cognitive deficits, and prevented the upregulation of eNMDAR expression in APP/PS1 mice in a GLT-1-dependent manner. These protective effects on hippocampal mitochondrial dysfunction and cognitive deficits were counteracted by eNMDAR activation. Furthermore, Cef incubation inhibited eNMDAR-mediated calcium influx in a GLT-1-dependent way and reduced MMP in primary cortical neurons. Notably, Cef incubation significantly suppressed mitochondrial calcium overload, which was mechanistically linked to the observed decline in MMP.

This study investigates the role of the ubiquitination-related gene EEF1A1 in SLE pathogenesis, focusing on T cell dysfunction. METHODS: Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from the GSE135779 dataset was analyzed to characterize the cellular composition of SLE samples. Clustering analysis identified 15 T cell subpopulations, with seven clusters notably depleted in SLE. Trajectory analysis indicated progressive transcriptional dysregulation during T cell differentiation. High-dimensional weighted gene coexpression network analysis (hdWGCNA) and LASSO regression highlighted EEF1A1 as a key ubiquitination-related hub gene. EEF1A1 expression was significantly elevated in SLE T cells, while its ubiquitinated form was reduced, suggesting impaired proteasomal degradation. RESULTS: Functional assays demonstrated that EEF1A1 overexpression enhances STAT1 phosphorylation (p-STAT1) without altering total STAT1 protein levels, leading to T cell dysfunction. In vitro and in vivo experiments revealed that EEF1A1 overexpression skews the T helper 1 (Th1)/T helper 2 (Th2) balance towards a Th1-dominant phenotype. In MRL/lpr mouse models, EEF1A1 overexpression exacerbated renal pathology, including increased proteinuria and immune complex deposition.

Results showed that QS treatment significantly improved symptoms and alleviated renal damage in these mice. Metabolomics and Western blot analyses further demonstrated that abnormal elevations of proteins related to purine metabolism and the NF-kappaB pathway were closely associated with LN's pathogenesis.

Despite advances in understanding SLE pathogenesis, the molecular mechanisms driving aberrant B cell differentiation remain elusive. Melatonin, a neuroendocrine hormone with immunomodulatory properties, has been shown to regulate immune responses, but its role in B cell differentiation and SLE is poorly understood. This study investigates the role of melatonin and its receptors in B cell differentiation and SLE pathogenesis. We observed reduced serum melatonin levels and decreased expression of melatonin receptors in B cells from SLE patients and MRL/Lpr mice. Activation of melatonin receptors inhibited the protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway and reduced phosphorylation of cyclic-AMP response binding protein (CREB), leading to epigenetic downregulation of PRDM1 and IRF4, key transcription factors for plasmablast and plasma cell differentiation. Consequently, melatonin receptor activation suppressed abnormal B cell differentiation into antibody-secreting cells.

In this study, we focused on the PAK3-R67C variant, the most amino-terminal variation identified to date, which was initially associated with a non-syndromic form of X-linked ID. We describe the clinical picture of its second occurrence, and present additional clinical insights. Our findings indicate that the R67C mutation is associated with moderate to severe ID, along with speech and gait abnormalities, and features consistent with autism spectrum disorders. To explore these associations further, we conducted a comprehensive phenotypic analysis using a corresponding knock-in mouse model. The Pak3-R67C mice, which present significant microcephaly, displayed mild motor deficits, social avoidance behaviour, and impaired emotional learning and memory. At the physiological level, Pak3-R67C mice exhibited reduced hippocampal synaptic efficacy and defects in long-term potentiation, despite unaltered synapse structure. In vitro biochemical assays revealed that the PAK3-R67C variant enhances interactions with PAK-interacting exchange factors (PIX). Notably, the expression of this variant in COS7 cells, altered the distribution of focal adhesions, while cell migration capacity remained unaffected. Collectively, these data, which include the second reported occurrence of the R67C variant, a detailed characterization of the corresponding knock-in mouse line, and a multi-tiered analysis of its biological and biochemical properties, contribute to a better understanding of the genotype-phenotype relationship in PAK3-related disorders.", "authors": "Dobrigna M; Poëa-Guyon S; Legras M; Le Verger D; Duarte K; Sébrié C; Poirier R; Granon S; Marty S; Toutain A; Dallérac G; Vaillend C; Barnier JV", "fulltext_url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nbd.2025.107188", "keywords": "Long-term potentiation[MeSH Terms] AND mouse[MeSH Terms]", "llm_relevance_assessment": {"relevance_score": 9, "relevance_level": "High", "species_check": "The pathway is in Mus musculus (mouse), and the study uses a mouse model (Pak3-R67C knock-in mice), making the species alignment valid.", "evidence_summary": "The Pak3-R67C mice exhibited reduced hippocampal synaptic efficacy and defects in long-term potentiation.

S-palmitoylation, a reversible post-translational lipid modification, modulates synaptic protein function by influencing protein conformation, localization, trafficking, and molecular interactions. Despite its known significance in neuronal function, the temporal and protein-specific dynamics of S-palmitoylation during synaptic plasticity remain poorly understood. METHODOLOGY & PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using electrophysiological methods, molecular biology, proteomics, and imaging across various models (neuronal cultures, hippocampal slices, and synaptoneurosomes), we investigated S-palmitoylation during synaptic activity. Induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) resulted in protein-specific palmitoylation changes without altering global levels. In hippocampal slices, synaptophysin and PSD95 displayed distinct temporal patterns of palmitoylation, influenced by LTP. Deacylation experiments using N-(tert-butyl)hydroxylamine (NtBuHA) demonstrated that protein S-palmitoylation is crucial for organizing neuronal spiking and enabling LTP, particularly in the stratum radiatum. Mass spectrometry of synaptoneurosomes revealed a palmitoylome including over 700 proteins, with stimulation-induced predominant depalmitoylation. Differentially palmitoylated proteins were associated with synaptic vesicle cycling, cytoskeletal dynamics, and neurotransmitter release. What is interesting is that synaptoneurosomes contained active palmitoylation machinery, supporting rapid, target-specific responses to NMDA receptor activation. CONCLUSIONS: Temporal and protein-specific S-palmitoylation emerges as a vital mechanism for synaptic plasticity, contributing to neuronal network function and memory formation.

The etiology of these diseases is thought to be associated with the conversion of a normal protein, PrPC, into an infectious, pathogenic form, PrPSc. The conversion is induced by prion infections (for example, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), iatrogenic CJD, Kuru), mutations (familial CJD, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome, fatal familial insomnia (FFI)) or unknown factors (sporadic CJD (sCJD)), and is thought to occur after PrPC has reached the plasma membrane or is re-internalized for degradation. The PrPSc form shows greater protease resistance than PrPC and accumulates in affected individuals, often in the form of extracellular plaques. Pathways that may lead to neuronal death comprise oxidative stress, regulated activation of complement, ubiquitin-proteasome and endosomal-lysosomal systems, synaptic alterations and dendritic atrophy, corticosteroid response, and endoplasmic reticulum stress. In addition, the conformational transition could lead to the lost of a beneficial activity of the natively folded protein, PrPC.", "genes": ["100041273"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "41186731", "title": "Intracellular trafficking SNARE protein, syntaxin-6, modifies prion cellular phenotypes and risk of disease development in vivo.", "abstract": "Increased expression of syntaxin-6, a SNARE protein involved in intracellular protein trafficking, is a proposed genetic risk mechanism for sporadic prion disease and progressive supranuclear palsy, as well as being implicated in Alzheimer's disease. However, no study has validated its functional role in prion disease, its mechanism of action nor explored the disease stage at which it is acting. Here, we show that syntaxin-6 knockdown in cellular models increases cell-associated infectivity, whilst overexpression produces the opposite effect. This observation is broadly consistent across multiple cell types and prion strains. Furthermore, syntaxin-6 knockdown leads to an accumulation of perinuclear disease-related PrP, consistent with a trafficking mechanism, and alters the morphology of disease-related PrP. We demonstrate that syntaxin-6 knockdown reduces the secretion of prions from infected cells, which provides a mechanism for the prion-related cellular phenotypes observed. Complementary in vivo studies showed that syntaxin-6 influences early stages of prion disease in experimental mice, increasing transmission risk after inoculation with low prion doses. Conversely, syntaxin-6 does not affect prion propagation kinetics or toxicity during established disease. Taken together, our studies firmly establish syntaxin-6 as a modifier of prion pathogenesis with a role in prion trafficking and export. Our findings further suggest that syntaxin-6 modifies the risk of the establishment of disease in line with its genetic association in humans.

Definitive diagnosis currently relies on post-mortem histopathological examination of the central nervous system. Among emerging diagnostic tools, <i>in vitro</i> amplification techniques such as Real-Time Quaking-Induced Conversion (RT-QuIC) have demonstrated high sensitivity, specificity, and speed, although certain prion strains remain difficult to amplify. Here, we evaluate a novel recombinant substrate for RT-QuIC: human PrP E219K, a naturally occurring polymorphism in which lysine substitutes glutamic acid at codon 219. Using this substrate, we successfully amplified six sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (sCJD) strains and the variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) strain from both human PrP transgenic (tg650) mouse brain homogenates and directly from patients' samples. In tg650-passaged prions, amplification reactions were initiated between 3 and 36 hours for sCJD prions and between 11 and 31 hours for vCJD prions, covering a 5- to 7-log dilution range depending on the strain. For patient brain homogenates, amplification reactions started between 0 and 27 hours for sCJDs and between 17 and 35 hours for vCJD, covering a 5- to 8-log dilution range depending on the strain. VV1 prions from a patient sample could only be amplified over a 2-log dilution range. Moreover, lag times of amplification reactions enabled reliable discrimination between vCJD and all tested sCJD subtypes. These findings represent a significant advance toward ante-mortem typing of human prion diseases. IMPORTANCE: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder within the prion disease family. Definitive diagnosis and strain typing currently require post-mortem analyses. In this study, we demonstrate that the human PrP E219K variant serves as an effective substrate for prion in vitro amplification using real-time quaking-induced conversion. This substrate enables (i) rapid and robust amplification of the most common human prion strains and (ii) clear and direct discrimination between variant CJD and all tested sporadic CJD subtypes, based on statistical analyses of lag times of the prion amplification reactions.

As characterized by its aberrant nuclear export and cytoplasmic aggregation, TDP43 proteinopathy is a hallmark feature in over 95% of ALS/FTD cases, leading to detrimental cytosolic aggregates and a reduction in nuclear functionality in neurons. Building on our prior work linking TDP43 proteinopathy to the accumulation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in neurons, the present investigation uncovers a novel regulatory relationship between TDP43 and DNA mismatch repair (MMR) gene expression. Here, we show that TDP43 depletion or overexpression directly affects the expression of key MMR genes. Alterations include changes in MLH1, MSH2, MSH3, MSH6, and PMS2 levels across various primary cell lines, independent of their proliferative status. Our results specifically establish that TDP43 selectively influences the expression of MLH1 and MSH6 by influencing their alternative transcript splicing patterns and stability. We furthermore find that aberrant MMR gene expression is linked to TDP43 proteinopathy in two distinct ALS mouse models and in post-mortem brain and spinal cord tissues of ALS patients. Notably, MMR depletion resulted in the partial rescue of TDP43 proteinopathy-induced DNA damage and signaling. Moreover, bioinformatics analysis of the TCGA cancer database reveals significant associations between TDP43 expression, MMR gene expression, and mutational burden across multiple cancers.

METHODS: We first analyzed the correlation between <i>F. nucleatum</i> abundance and mismatch repair (MMR) protein deficiency in CRC tissues from 567 patients. We then treated CRC cells and tissues with <i>F. nucleatum</i> and its metabolites. RNA sequencing was used to evaluate the involved pathways, and non-targeted metabolomics was employed to analyze the metabolites regulating MLH1. CRC cells were treated with butyrate, a metabolite of <i>F. nucleatum</i>, with or without the autophagy-lysosome pathway inhibitor chloroquine or mTOR activator MHY1485.

RESULTS: The results showed that the abundance of <i>F. nucleatum</i> in CRC tissues is correlated with MSI and MLH1 deficiency. <i>F. nucleatum</i>, its culture supernatant, and its metabolite butyrate cause the downregulation of MLH1 protein via autophagy-lysosome pathway.

However, only a small subset of CRC patients harboring deficient mismatch repair (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) benefits from ICB therapy. A very limited response to ICB therapy has been achieved in MMR-proficient CRC, representing a significant challenge limiting the clinical application of immunotherapy. MMR is the critical DNA repair pathway that maintains genomic integrity by correcting DNA mismatches, which is mediated by the MutSα or MutSβ complex consisting of MSH2 with MSH6 and MSH3, respectively. Given that MMR status directs effective immune response, we sought to determine whether targeting MMR capacity boosts ICB efficacy. METHODS: Azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate (AOM/DSS)-induced CRC and xenograft model were used to evaluate the function of PRMT6 and response to PRMT6 inhibitor EPZ020411 and combination therapy of PD1 and EPZ020411. Biochemical assays were performed to elucidate the underlying mechanism of PRMT6-mediated MSH2 methylation and immune evasion. RESULTS: We have identified PRMT6 as a crucial regulator of MMR capacity via MSH2 dimethylation at R171 and R219. Such a modification abrogates its MMR capacity and prevents the recruitment of MSH3 and MSH6. PRMT6 loss or inhibition triggers cytosolic DNA accumulation and cGAS-STING signaling activation, leading to enhanced immune response in PRMT6-deficient colon tumors or xenografts. Pharmacological inhibition of PRMT6 using EPZ020411 promotes mutagenesis and destabilizes MutSα or MutSβ assembly, and prolonged EPZ020411 exposure maintains an MSI-like phenotype in microsatellite stability (MSS) cells. EPZ020411 treatment sensitizes ICB efficacy of MSS cells, but not MSI cells in vivo. Similar effects have been observed in MSS colon tumors induced by AOM/DSS.

Here, we identified that nuclear proto-oncogene SET is significantly higher expressed in MSS CRC compared to microsatellite instability (MSI) CRC and facilitates immune escape of MSS CRC. Mechanistically, SET represses the expression of C-C motif chemokine ligand 5 (CCL5) and upregulates mismatch repair (MMR) proteins expression in a c-Myc-dependent manner, which inhibits infiltration and migration of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to tumor tissues and results in low immunogenicity in MSS CRC.

Despite high initial response rates to chemotherapy and modest survival improvements with the addition of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI), almost all patients experience relapse and fatal outcomes. Recent genomic insights uncovered extensive molecular heterogeneity in addition to the almost uniform loss of RB1 and TRP53. Additionally, defective DNA mismatch repair (MMR) has recently been described in some SCLC cases. Here, we generated a novel SCLC mouse model capturing MMR deficiency and assessed immunotherapy responses. METHODS: We developed an MMR-deficient genetically engineered mouse model (GEMM) of SCLC by introducing a conditional Msh2 gene, crucial for maintaining MMR integrity, into the standard Rb1<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Trp53<sup>fl/fl</sup> (RP) model. Genomic characteristics and preclinical therapy responses were evaluated by focusing on overall survival and whole exome sequencing (WES) analyses. RESULTS: MMR-defective SCLC tumors (Rb1<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Trp53<sup>fl/fl</sup>;Msh2<sup>fl/fl</sup> (RPM)) developed later than tumors in MMR-proficient mice. However, the time from tumor manifestation to death of the affected animals was substantially shortened (median survival 55 days in RP vs. 46.5 days in RPM), indicating increased aggressiveness of MMR-defective tumors. RPM tumors exhibited MMR deficiency, high tumor mutational burden (TMB), and an elevated load of candidate neoantigens, compared to RP lesions (p = 0.0106), suggesting increased immunogenicity. Importantly, the overall survival of RPM animals was significantly improved when exposed to ICI. CONCLUSION: We propose a novel RPM mouse model as a suitable system to mimic MMR-defective SCLC and tumors with high TMB. We provide in vivo evidence that Msh2 deficiency enhances ICI sensitivity.

Furthermore, expression of the associated protein sets also correlated with ADAM10 expression in human GBM and colon cancer specimens (TCGA datasets), indicating clinical relevance.

At the cell-extracellular matrix contact points, specialized structures are formed and termed focal adhesions, where bundles of actin filaments are anchored to transmembrane receptors of the integrin family through a multi-molecular complex of junctional plaque proteins. Some of the constituents of focal adhesions participate in the structural link between membrane receptors and the actin cytoskeleton, while others are signalling molecules, including different protein kinases and phosphatases, their substrates, and various adapter proteins. Integrin signaling is dependent upon the non-receptor tyrosine kinase activities of the FAK and src proteins as well as the adaptor protein functions of FAK, src and Shc to initiate downstream signaling events. These signalling events culminate in reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton; a prerequisite for changes in cell shape and motility, and gene expression. Similar morphological alterations and modulation of gene expression are initiated by the binding of growth factors to their respective receptors, emphasizing the considerable crosstalk between adhesion- and growth factor-mediated signalling.", "genes": ["104099"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "40934290", "title": "Preventing hypocontractility-induced fibroblast expansion alleviates dilated cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "Cardiomyocyte hypocontractility underlies inherited dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).

While current therapies have proven effective, they are limited by side effects arising and by the development of drug resistance. For this reason, identifying new therapeutic targets and predictive biomarkers is crucial. Semaphorin 5 A (SEMA5A) is a member of the Semaphorin family, implicated in both cancer biology and neural development. We have previously demonstrated that this protein promotes different aggressive features of melanoma cells. In this study, we conducted a more in-depth investigation into the role of SEMA5A in the development and progression of melanoma. METHODS: We performed proteomic and in silico analysis of stable knockdown SEMA5A human melanoma cells to identify the cellular pathways modulated by SEMA5A. The data used are available via ProteomeXchange with the identifier PXD065661. In vitro cell migration, clonogenic ability and cell viability assays under different adhesive substrate conditions were conducted using both human and murine melanoma SEMA5A-depleted clones. Western blotting and immunofluorescence analyses were employed to investigate focal adhesion regulation and lamellipodia formation. A Nocodazole assay was used to evaluate focal adhesion dynamics. A xenograft mouse model of melanoma was used to investigate the role of SEMA5A in tumor formation and tumor growth. Paraffin tumor sections were analyzed using immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: DAVID functional annotation tool revealed significant enrichment of Focal Adhesion and Integrin pathway-associated proteins in both control and SEMA5A-silenced cells. Ingenuity pathway analysis highlighted the role of SEMA5A in modulating several cellular pathways, including focal adhesion and lamellipodia organization. We demonstrated that SEMA5A depletion reduces the migration, clonogenic capacity, and viability of melanoma cells in both low and high stiffness culture substrates. SEMA5A was found to affect FAK and paxillin phosphorylation, as well as RhoA and Integrin β1 activation. This regulates focal adhesion dynamics, and lamellipodia formation. Furthermore, SEMA5A was found to regulate Arp3 nucleation and expression. Delayed tumor formation and reduced tumor growth were observed in mice bearing melanoma xenografts expressing low levels of SEMA5A. Immunohistochemical analysis of xenograft tumor sections revealed increased level of active Integrin β1 and phosphorylated FAK in SEMA5A-silenced tumors compared to control.

METHODS: We employed in vitro loss- and gain-of-function assays using shRNA-mediated knockdown and ectopic overexpression of MACF1 and NR2F1 in LUAD cell lines (H1299 and Calu-3). Cell proliferation, adhesion, and migration were assessed by CCK-8, EdU, crystal violet, and Transwell assays. In vivo tumor growth and metastasis were evaluated using subcutaneous and tail vein xenograft models in nude mice. RNA-seq and GSEA were performed to identify MACF1-regulated pathways, followed by nuclear-cytoplasmic fractionation, dual-luciferase reporter assays, and immunofluorescence to assess WNT/β-catenin activity. ChIP-qPCR and ChIP-seq data from ENCODE were used to validate NR2F1 binding to the MACF1 promoter. RESULTS: MACF1 knockdown significantly suppressed LUAD cell proliferation, DNA replication, adhesion, and migration, and reduced tumor burden and lung metastases in vivo. Mechanistically, MACF1 activated WNT/β-catenin signaling by promoting CTNNB1 nuclear translocation, which upregulated focal adhesion genes (Paxillin, FAK, ITGB1). CTNNB1 agonist TWS119 restored focal adhesion in MACF1-deficient cells. Bioinformatic prediction and ChIP validation identified NR2F1 as a transcription factor directly targeting the MACF1 promoter. NR2F1 deficiency reduced MACF1 expression and phenocopied its functional loss, while MACF1 overexpression rescued the impaired phenotype. CONCLUSION: Our study uncovers a previously unrecognized NR2F1-MACF1-WNT axis that drives focal adhesion formation and LUAD progression. Targeting this regulatory circuit may offer new avenues for anti-metastatic therapy in lung adenocarcinoma. HIGHLIGHTS: 1. NR2F1 is identified as a direct upstream transcription factor that activates MACF1 expression in LUAD. 2. MACF1 promotes LUAD cell proliferation, adhesion, and migration by enhancing focal adhesion assembly. 3. MACF1 activates the WNT/CTNNB1 signaling cascade, facilitating CTNNB1 nuclear translocation and downstream target expression. 4.

The gene product contains a central armadillo-repeat containing domain through which it binds the cytoplasmic tail of classical cadherins; meanwhile, it also binds alpha-catenin, which further links the cadherin complex to the actin cytoskeleton either directly or indirectly. Beta-catenin is therefore necessary for the adhesive function of classical cadherins. Another key function of this protein is to mediate the canonical Wnt signaling pathway and regulate gene transcription. Without Wnt signal, cytoplasmic beta-catenin that is not associated with the cadherin complex is quickly phosphorylated at the N-terminal Ser/Thr residues by the so called degradation complex containing axin, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), casein kinase I, and GSK3B, then ubiquitylated by beta-TrCP, and degraded by the proteasome. However, in the presence of Wnt signal, the degradation complex is disrupted and the stabilized cytoplasmic beta-catenin translocates into the nucleus, where it binds various transcription factors and, together with these factors, regulates the transcription of many downstream genes. Mutations of this gene have been linked with various types of tumors. Alternatively spliced variants have been found for this gene.

In this study, we investigated the effects of actin stabilization on adhesion properties, contractility, and cell migration. For this, we used the recently synthesized actin stabilizer miuraenamide A (MiuA), which has been discussed as a more reliable alternative to the otherwise commonly used actin stabilizer jasplakinolide. We investigated the number and size of focal adhesions in RPE-1 cells and used single-cell force spectroscopy to evaluate the adhesion properties of those cells after MiuA treatment. We showed that MiuA increases the number of focal adhesions while decreasing their size and reduces adhesion energy and force. Additionally, we investigated its effects on the contractility of RPE-1 cells by measuring their contractile energy using pattern-based contractility screening (PaCS). We found no significant change in contractility after MiuA treatment. Finally, we confined RPE-1 cells in PDMS microchannels and analyzed their migration after treatment with MiuA, showing that neither their speed nor their persistence is affected by MiuA. To check that these effects are not specific to RPE-1 cells, we also analyzed the effects of MiuA treatment in MEF cells and neutrophils. Both MEF cells and neutrophils showed the same results as the RPE-1 cells. Our measurements indicate that, although altering focal adhesions significantly reduces adhesion, it does not impact cell contractility.

These cells also start expressing adipocyte specific transcription factors and marker genes while continuing to express osteoblast specific differentiated features. The mechanistic reason for this shift in differentiation behavior is not known. Recent studies have suggested a role for vinculin, a protein component of focal adhesions, in the transduction of signals to YAP-TAZ transcription factors to suppress adipocyte differentiation and allow osteoblast differentiation. We found loss of Rb1 expression in osteoblasts dramatically reduced vinculin quantity, with less distribution within focal adhesions when tested by immunofluorescence. Vinculin levels steadily increased during in vitro osteoblast differentiation and were about 6-8-fold higher in differentiated osteoblasts. Rb1 deficient cells showed an increase albeit at reduced levels (2-4-fold) during differentiation. A corresponding increase in YAP-TAZ activity and expression were seen in control osteoblasts and a stunted but similar response was present in Rb1 deficient osteoblasts. The fact that Rb1 deficient osteoblasts respond by increasing vinculin levels suggests that they can maintain the expected functional changes at a reduced level. To demonstrate that the concentration of vinculin was the determining factor, we either over expressed or knocked down vinculin which resulted in appropriately altering YAP/TAZ activity. Increased vinculin expression enhanced osteogenic while inhibiting adipocytic gene expression. During osteoblast differentiation, TAZ can be clearly visualized in the nucleus in osteoblasts' whereas with Rb1 deficiency the distribution was diffuse within the cells. The reduction in vinculin expression, combined with a feeble response in YAP-TAZ signaling activity, may explain the lack of complete inhibition of adipocyte specific gene expression and a generation of a mixed phenotype seen with loss of Rb1 function. As the adipocyte master transcription factor PPAR-gamma levels are increased by Rb1 loss, we knockdown PPAR-gamma which resulted in an increase to vinculin expression, showing that the PPAR-gamma induced activation of adipocyte differentiation pathway is responsible for reducing vinculin expression in RbKD cells.", "authors": "Pendleton E; Abdallah K; Chandar N", "fulltext_url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yexcr.2025.114690", "keywords": "Focal adhesion[MeSH Terms] AND mouse[MeSH Terms]", "llm_relevance_assessment": {"relevance_score": 9, "relevance_level": "High", "species_check": "The pathway is for Mus musculus (house mouse), and the study uses mouse osteoblasts, making the species match valid.", "evidence_summary": ["Recent studies have suggested a role for vinculin, a protein component of focal adhesions, in the transduction of signals to YAP-TAZ transcription factors to suppress adipocyte differentiation and allow osteoblast differentiation.", "We found loss of Rb1 expression in osteoblasts dramatically reduced vinculin quantity, with less distribution within focal adhesions when tested by immunofluorescence."], "reasoning": "The article directly investigates focal adhesion-related proteins (specifically vinculin) and their role in signaling pathways (YAP-TAZ) that influence cell differentiation.

Ciliary dysfunction causes ciliopathy in humans. Centrosomal protein 290 (CEP290), a ciliary protein implicated in ciliopathies, localizes to the ciliary base and the centrosome in ciliated cells. CEP290-related ciliopathies arise from molecular dysfunctions of the CEP290 molecule, exhibiting a diverse range of symptoms. Thus far, these disorders have been attributed to cilia-specific functional abnormalities of CEP290, reflecting the conventional view of its primary role within cilia. However, CEP290 is also expressed in proliferating non-ciliated cells and localizes to the centrosome, suggesting potential cilia-independent functions of CEP290 in the pathophysiology of these disorders. In this study, we investigated the cilia-independent functions of CEP290 in non-ciliated cells. Our findings reveal that the loss of Cep290 function impairs microtubule elongation due to malfunction of the microtubule organizing center. Notably, CEP290 forms a complex with adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), a protein that localizes to the centrosome and associates with microtubules. Importantly, reduced focal adhesion formation appears to underlie the phenotypic abnormalities observed in Cep290 knockout cells, including impaired collective cell migration, altered cell morphology, and reduced adhesive capacity to the extracellular matrix. The APC-CEP290 complex plays a consistent and crucial role in stabilizing a focal adhesion molecule, paxillin, at the leading edge in non-ciliated cells.

METHODS: The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) online database and tissue chips were used to analyze the expression levels of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2)- and non-catalytic region of tyrosine kinase adaptor protein (NCK)- interacting kinase (TNIK) protein in lung cancer. A549 and PC-9 lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) cells with stable TNIK knockdown were generated by lentivirus infection. The tumor phenotypes were subsequently examined both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. The TCGA online database and RNA-sequencing of TNIK-knockdown cells were used to study the molecular mechanism underlying the TNIK-mediated phenotype of LUAD cells. The effects of TNIK knockdown on focal adhesion dynamics and mitosis were examined by indirect immunofluorescence and Western blot, on the sensitivity to chemotherapy drugs by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, on apoptosis by flow cytometry, and on cell proliferation by 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EDU). RESULTS: TNIK was highly expressed in LUAD (<i>p</i> < 0.0001), predominantly in the cytosol. Phenotype assays revealed that TNIK knockdown in LUAD cells led to a significant increase in cell spreading (<i>p</i> < 0.0001), but also inhibition of cell growth and movement (<i>p</i> < 0.01). Mechanistically, TNIK was found to regulate F-actin and microtubule organization, as well as the Ras homolog gene family (RHO)/RHO-associated kinase 2 (ROCK2)/LIM motif-containing protein kinase 1 (LIMK1) signaling pathway, thereby playing a crucial role in the control of focal adhesion turnover and mitosis. Additionally, the silencing of TNIK enhanced the sensitivity of LUAD cells to chemotherapeutic drugs.

Furthermore, we found that mutations with high scores cause ASD by mechanisms either dependent on or independent of loss of chromatin-remodeling function.

In this study, we establish that deletion of <i>Chd7</i> in neural crest cells (NCCs) causes severe conotruncal defects and perinatal lethality, thus providing mouse genetic evidence demonstrating that CHD7 cell-autonomously regulates cardiac NCC development, thereby clarifying a long-standing controversy in the literature. Using transcriptomic analyses, we show that CHD7 fine-tunes the expression of a gene network that is critical for cardiac NCC development. To gain further molecular insights into gene regulation by CHD7, we performed a protein-protein interaction screen by incubating recombinant CHD7 on a protein array. We find that CHD7 directly interacts with several developmental disorder-mutated proteins including WDR5, a core component of H3K4 methyltransferase complexes. This direct interaction suggested that CHD7 may recruit histone-modifying enzymes to target loci independently of its remodeling functions. We therefore generated a mouse model that harbors an ATPase-deficient allele and demonstrates that mutant CHD7 retains the ability to recruit H3K4 methyltransferase activity to its targets. Thus, our data uncover that CHD7 regulates cardiovascular development through ATP-dependent and -independent activities, shedding light on the etiology of CHD7-related congenital disorders.

Transcriptomics profiling revealed cellular heterogeneity between heart chambers. However, the mechanisms underlying chamber-specific transcriptomic and metabolic differences-and their functional significance-remain poorly understood. The Hippo/YAP (yes-associated protein) pathway is a conserved signaling network that regulates diverse cellular processes. The Hippo kinases inhibit YAP in cardiac fibroblasts (CF) to restrict fibrosis and inflammation. Nonetheless, how YAP regulates the metabolic microenvironment during homeostasis and fibroinflammation remains unclear. METHODS: We investigated YAP and glycolysis activity in the 4 cardiac chambers by scoring the expression of YAP target genes and glycolysis genes in human single-nucleus RNA sequencing data. To compare glucose uptake between the left and right atria, we measured isotope-labeled glucose uptake in isolated mouse atria. To study the role of YAP in CFs, we inactivated the Hippo kinases, <i>Lats1</i> and <i>Lats2</i>, in mouse CFs and performed metabolic studies, snRNA-seq, single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing, and spatial transcriptomics. RESULTS: Metabolic and sequencing approaches revealed that Hippo-deficient CFs activated glycolysis to promote fibroinflammation. Inhibition of glycolysis or lactate production suppressed Hippo-deficient CF-induced fibrosis. Elevated YAP activity disrupted fibroblast lineage fidelity by inducing an osteochondroprogenitor cell state. Blocking macrophage expansion pharmacologically reduced Hippo-deficient CF proliferation and fibrosis. Sequencing and functional studies showed that macrophages secreted IGF1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) to activate IGF1 signaling in Hippo-deficient CFs to increase cell proliferation and fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: We discovered that right atrial CFs are more glycolytic and have higher YAP activity than CFs in other heart chambers. YAP activation in CFs induces glycolysis to drive fibrosis. YAP disrupts fibroblast lineage fidelity, driving them to a SOX9 (SRY-box transcription factor 9)-expressing osteochondroprogenitor cell state. Mechanistically, YAP activates the secretion of CSF1 (colony-stimulating factor 1) to promote macrophage expansion. Blocking macrophage expansion reduces Hippo-deficient CF proliferation, osteochondroprogenitor differentiation, and fibrosis, revealing that macrophages signal reciprocally to regulate CF cell states. Genomic and functional studies revealed that the upregulated IGF1 receptor in Hippo-deficient CFs enables them to receive macrophage-secreted IGF1, thereby further enhancing CF proliferation and fibrosis.", "authors": "Tsai CR; Liu L; Zhao Y; Kim JH; Czarnewski P; Li RG; Meng F; Zheng M; Steimle J; Zhao X; Grisanti F; Sun Z; Wang J; Samee MAH; Li X; Martin JF", "fulltext_url": "https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.125.326480", "keywords": "Hippo signaling pathway[MeSH Terms] AND mouse[MeSH Terms] AND Mus musculus (house mouse)[MeSH Terms]", "llm_relevance_assessment": {"relevance_score": 9, "relevance_level": "High", "species_check": "The pathway is in Mus musculus (house mouse), and the study uses mouse cardiac fibroblasts and atrial tissue, making the species alignment valid.", "evidence_summary": "The Hippo kinases inhibit YAP in cardiac fibroblasts (CF) to restrict fibrosis and inflammation.

Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP) is a key effector molecule of Hippo pathway. Previous studies have found abnormal YAP overexpression in many solid tumors, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Here, we attempt to explore the cancer-promoting mechanism of YAP in HCC. The target gene of Hippo-YAP pathway, Four and a half LIM domain protein 3 (FHL3), was screened by spontaneous hydrodynamic tumor model with YAP participation and two publicly HCC microarray sets. Western blot (WB) and immunohistochemical (IHC) showed high protein levels of FHL3 in tumor tissues and the expression of FHL3 was associated with poorer prognosis. The biological effect experiments showed that FHL3 significantly promoted the progression of HCC. FHL3 interacted with MYC-associated zinc finger protein (MAZ) to recruit MAZ binding to the G-quadruplexes (G4s) structure, which promoted Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homologue (KRAS) transcription and activation of its downstream signal. Down-regulating KRAS expression inhibited the promoting effect of YAP-FHL3 signaling on HCC. In addition, transactivation of FHL3 mediated by YAP was verified by luciferase reporter assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). FHL3 knockdown inhibited the tumor-promoting effect of YAP and significantly delayed the tumorigenesis and progression caused by YAP.

Ferroptosis is vital in health and disease, regulating LUAD cell death through iron and lipid peroxidation. How mechanical signals are transduced into the electrochemical determinants that govern ferroptosis remains fundamentally unexplored. METHODS: LUAD cells were cultured on polyacrylamide (PA) hydrogel of varying stiffness to mimic physiological and pathological ECM conditions. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) was employed to identify differential expressed genes (DEGs) across varying ECM stiffness conditions, followed by molecular validation of potential regulatory mechanisms through in vitro experiments, in vivo studies, and clinical samples. Based on this mechanistic insight, we aimed to develop nanocarriers for drug encapsulation and assess their therapeutic efficacy in vitro. RESULTS: Our study have demonstrated that elevated ECM stiffness suppressed ferroptosis in LUAD cells. Mechanistically, high ECM stiffness elevated integrin levels, suppressed the Hippo pathway, and increased YAP levels, which upregulated the downstream molecule ATP-Binding Cassette G1 (ABCG1), thereby reducing ferroptosis sensitivity. This mechanistic model was rigorously validated through a combination of stepwise molecular knockdown experiments in vitro, supporting animal studies in vivo, and analyses of clinical patient samples. Notably, dihydromyricetin (DMY) downregulated ABCG1 expression and sensitized cells to ferroptosis, which was further enhanced by nanocarrier-mediated drug delivery for improved therapeutic outcome. CONCLUSION: Our findings revealed a novel mechanism by which ECM stiffness regulated ferroptosis via the Integrin-Hippo-ABCG1 pathway in LUAD.

In this study, we show that IDE expression is reduced in the nigrostriatal region of aging homozygous A53T α-syn mice and in α-syn-overexpressing SH-SY5Y PD cells. Overexpression of IDE alleviated motor deficits, reduced pathological α-syn levels, and protected dopaminergic neurons in A53T α-syn mice. In SH-SY5Y PD model cells, IDE overexpression reduced α-syn-induced toxicity, whereas IDE knockdown exacerbated it.

{"id": "mmu04670", "name": "Leukocyte transendothelial migration - Mus musculus (house mouse)", "description": "Leukocyte migaration from the blood into tissues is vital for immune surveillance and inflammation. During this diapedesis of leukocytes, the leukocytes bind to endothelial cell adhesion molecules (CAM) and then migrate across the vascular endothelium. A leukocyte adherent to CAMs on the endothelial cells moves forward by leading-edge protrusion and retraction of its tail. In this process, alphaL /beta2 integrin activates through Vav1, RhoA, which subsequently activates the kinase p160ROCK. ROCK activation leads to MLC phosphorylation, resulting in retraction of the actin cytoskeleton. Moreover, Leukocytes activate endothelial cell signals that stimulate endothelial cell retraction during localized dissociation of the endothelial cell junctions. ICAM-1-mediated signals activate an endothelial cell calcium flux and PKC, which are required for ICAM-1 dependent leukocyte migration. VCAM-1 is involved in the opening of the \"endothelial passage\" through which leukocytes can extravasate. In this regard, VCAM-1 ligation induces NADPH oxidase activation and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a Rac-mediated manner, with subsequent activation of matrix metallopoteinases and loss of VE-cadherin-mediated adhesion.", "genes": ["100039801"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "39923080", "title": "β2 integrin regulates neutrophil trans endothelial migration following traumatic brain injury.", "abstract": "Neutrophils are the first responders among peripheral immune cells to infiltrate the central nervous system following a traumatic brain injury (TBI), triggering neuroinflammation that can exacerbate secondary tissue damage.

Our comprehensive analysis of the molecular landscape surrounding the trauma in TBI mice has revealed a significant alteration in the abundance of β2 integrin (ITGB2), predominantly expressed by neutrophils and closely associated with immune responses. Using the fluid percussion injury (FPI) mouse model, we investigated the therapeutic efficacy of Rovelizumab, an agent that blocks ITGB2. The treatment has demonstrated significant improvements in neurologic function in TBI mice, attenuating blood-brain barrier permeability, mitigating oxidative stress and inflammatory mediator release, and enhancing cerebral perfusion. Moreover, ITGB2 blockade has effectively limited the adherence, migration, and infiltration of neutrophils, and has impeded the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) upon their activation. Finally, it was demonstrated that ITGB2 mediates these effects mainly through its interaction with intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM 1) of endotheliocyte.

In the systemic circulation, the step at which immune cells migrate out of the blood and across the endothelium, transendothelial migration, occurs via homophilic interactions between leukocyte PECAM-1 and CD99 and endothelial cell PECAM-1 and CD99. Previous work showed that rolling and adhesion of immune cells in the lung vasculature does not follow the classical paradigm of inflammatory recruitment; however, the transmigration step of this process has largely gone understudied. In this study, we demonstrate that polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) use PECAM-1 and CD99 when transmigrating in response to murine chemical, bacterial, and ischemia/reperfusion lung injury (IRI). We demonstrate that recruitment of PMNs in response to both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria is PECAM-1- and CD99-dependent. We implemented a method of intravital microscopy (IVM) of the pulmonary vasculature after IRI, with which we directly visualized and quantified transmigration. We demonstrate, in real time, that PMN enter the alveoli by crossing alveolar capillaries. Because PMNs are known to be independent mediators of both tissue damage and resolution of inflammation, we tested these effective blocking antibodies for survival effects in models of 50-60% mortality, but found none. In summary, our study shows that the classical transmigration protein interactions are necessary for the transmigration of PMNs into the airspace during response to four distinct inflammatory stimuli.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> Previous studies have shown that neutrophil extravasation in the lung was selectin-independent and the requirement for leukocyte integrins was stimulus-dependent.

Transendothelial migration (TEM) is a series of that enable leukocytes to squeeze through endothelial barriers and migrate into local tissues to perform immune functions. Several studies have shown that P. gingivalis-mediated endothelial damage initiates a series of proinflammatory signals that promote leukocyte adhesion. However, whether P. gingivalis is involved in TEM and thus influences immune cell recruitment remains unknown. In our study, we found that P. gingivalis gingipains could increase vascular permeability and promote Escherichia coli penetration by downregulating platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM-1) expression <i>in vitro</i>. Furthermore, we demonstrated that although P. gingivalis infection promoted monocyte adhesion, the TEM capacity of monocytes was substantially impaired, which might be due to the reduced CD99 and CD99L2 expression on gingipain-stimulated endothelial cells and leukocytes. Mechanistically, gingipains mediate CD99 and CD99L2 downregulation, possibly through the inhibition of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway. In addition, our <i>in vivo</i> model confirmed the role of P. gingivalis in promoting vascular permeability and bacterial colonization in the liver, kidney, spleen, and lung and in downregulating PECAM-1, CD99, and CD99L2 expression in endothelial cells and leukocytes. <b>IMPORTANCE</b> P. gingivalis is associated with a variety of systemic diseases and colonizes in distal locations in the body.

In this regard, visceral white adipose tissue (vWAT) plays a critical role, influencing energy metabolism, immunomodulation, and oxidative stress. Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) are key players in these processes within vWAT. While second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs) have significantly improved treatments for mental health disorders, their chronic use is associated with an increased risk of MetS. In this study, we explored the impact of SGAs on ADSCs to better understand their role in MetS and identify potential therapeutic targets. Our findings reveal that olanzapine disrupts lipid droplet formation during adipogenic differentiation, impairing insulin receptor endocytosis, turnover, and signaling. SGAs also alter the endolysosomal compartment, leading to acidic vesicle accumulation and increased lysosomal biogenesis through TFEB activation. PKCζ is crucial for the SGA-induced nuclear translocation of TFEB and acidic vesicle formation. Notably, inhibiting PKCζ restored insulin receptor tyrosine phosphorylation, normalized receptor turnover, and improved downstream signaling following olanzapine treatment. This activation of PKCζ by olanzapine is driven by increased phosphatidic acid synthesis via phospholipase D (PLD), following G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling activation. Overall, olanzapine and clozapine disrupt endolysosomal homeostasis and insulin signaling in a PKCζ-dependent manner.

This isozyme has a high preference for lipid hydroperoxides and protects cells against membrane lipid peroxidation and cell death.

This study identifies CCR4-NOT transcription complex subunit 7 (CNOT7) as a key factor mediating radiotherapy resistance in CRC by stabilizing XRCC6 protein and enhancing non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) mediated DNA damage repair (DDR) pathway. Proteomic analysis of 45 CRC tissues revealed that elevated CNOT7 expression correlates with poorer responses to neoadjuvant radiotherapy and lower disease control rate (DCR). We demonstrated that CNOT7 knockdown enhances radiosensitivity by impairing NHEJ mediated double-strand breaks (DSBs) repair and promoting apoptosis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, CNOT7 interacts with XRCC6 to stabilize its protein levels by inhibiting TRIM21-mediated K48-linked ubiquitination at lysine 526, thereby facilitating efficient DNA repair. CNOT7 accelerates degradation of TRIM21 mRNA through its deadenylase activity. Additionally, the combination of STL127705, an inhibitor of the XRCC6/XRCC5 heterodimer, with radiotherapy notably suppressed tumor growth in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) and cell line mouse transplant tumor models, especially in the context of CNOT7 deficiency.

The combined knock-outof DNA-PK<sub>cs</sub> and Rad54 reduces sensitivity to crosslinkers compared to cells lacking only Rad54, suggesting the involvement of another DSB repair pathway besides HR.

diversify antibody responses. Both are initiated by activation-induced cytidine deaminase, which induces DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) at specific regions within the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) locus. In CSR, DSBs occur at the switch (S) regions, allowing B cells to replace the IgM heavy chain constant region (CH) with other isotypes, thereby enhancing immune adaptability. This process is regulated by both cis and trans mechanisms, including the IgH super-enhancer 3' regulatory region (3'RR) and the production of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs). A recent study highlighted the role of MED12 in CSR through enhancer activation and the transcription of eRNA. Now, we show that heterogeneous ribonucleoprotein L (hnRNPL) acts as an additional regulator of CSR and LSR by forming an eRNA-associated complex with CstF64, a polyadenylation factor. This complex facilitates RNA polymerase II elongation and eRNA transcription at the 3'RR. Moreover, the hnRNPL/CstF64 complex promotes NHEJ-mediated DNA repair at both S and 3'RR regions, facilitating 53BP1 and Ku80 recruitment, thereby impacting the efficiency of CSR and LSR.

However, its intrinsic role in cancer cells remains largely unknown. We aim to explore the direct role of CD84 in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) progression and to clarify the underlying molecular mechanisms involved in nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) repair. Herein, we found that CD84 is frequently upregulated in various types of AML and leukemia initiation cells (LICs)-enriched cells. Knockdown or blocking of CD84 significantly inhibits the growth and induces the apoptosis of AML cells. Moreover, knockdown of CD84 significantly delays AML progression and prolongs the survival of the xenografted mice in vivo. Mechanistically, CD84 promotes the expression of NHEJ core factors by recruiting SAP and activating the AKT signaling pathway. Knockdown of CD84 inhibits NHEJ repair in AML cells via regulating the expression of NHEJ core factors, including PRKDC, LIG4, XRCC5, and DCLRE1C. Subsequently, this leads to double-strand breaks accumulation and cell apoptosis. Importantly, CD84 is required for the proliferation and self-renewal of human LICs.

It consists of two subunits: an inducibly-expressed HIF-1alpha subunit and a constitutively-expressed HIF-1beta subunit. Under normoxia, HIF-1 alpha undergoes hydroxylation at specific prolyl residues which leads to an immediate ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of the subunit. In contrast, under hypoxia, HIF-1 alpha subunit becomes stable and interacts with coactivators such as p300/CBP to modulate its transcriptional activity. Eventually, HIF-1 acts as a master regulator of numerous hypoxia-inducible genes under hypoxic conditions. The target genes of HIF-1 encode proteins that increase O2 delivery and mediate adaptive responses to O2 deprivation. Despite its name, HIF-1 is induced not only in response to reduced oxygen availability but also by other stimulants, such as nitric oxide, or various growth factors.", "genes": ["102631956"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "41316326", "title": "The N-butanol extract of modified Yanghe decoction alleviates ferroptosis in bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells in glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis by activating the HIF-1α/GPX4 signaling pathway.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP) represents the predominant type of secondary bone loss disorder, linked to a substantially elevated incidence of pathological fractures in clinical populations. Modified Yanghe Decoction (MYHD), a classical Chinese medicinal formula, has demonstrated therapeutic potential in managing osteoporotic conditions. Nevertheless, the specific mechanisms underlying MYHD's effectiveness against GIOP require further elucidation, posing challenges for broader clinical implementation. METHODS: We performed comprehensive analysis of bioactive constituents in the MYHD n-butanol (MYHD-NB) fraction through high-performance liquid chromatography, followed by mechanistic exploration of its biological effects across experimental models. Ten-week-old male C57BL/6J mice received dexamethasone (DEX)-induced modeling and were administered either MYHD or varying concentrations of MYHD-NB via oral gavage. Following an 8-week intervention, femoral specimens underwent multimodal evaluation including histopathological examination, micro-computed tomography imaging, and advanced molecular detection techniques (immunohistochemistry/immunofluorescence). Parallel bioinformatics analysis was executed on RNA-seq datasets from osteoporotic fracture patients in the GEO repository. For in vitro experimentation, DEX-treated murine BMSCs were employed to assess MYHD-NB's regulatory effects on cellular proliferation, migratory capacity, osteogenic differentiation potential, and ferroptotic processes. Complementary network pharmacology approaches were utilized to predict potential molecular targets and pathway interactions. RESULTS: MYHD-NB significantly improved the osteoporosis-like phenotype in mice, as indicated by the improvement of bone microstructure and the upregulation of ALP and RUNX2 expression. RNA-seq analysis of the GEO dataset showed that ferroptosis-related genes are significantly upregulated in the femurs of GIOP patients. Both in vivo and in vitro studies confirmed MYHD-NB's capacity to mitigate dexamethasone-induced ferroptosis in BMSCs while enhancing BMSCs proliferation capacity, migratory potential, and differentiation into osteogenic lineages. Network pharmacology predictions identified HIF-1α as the pivotal regulator mediating MYHD-NB's anti-ferroptotic effects. Molecular investigations revealed MYHD-NB's activation of the HIF-1α/GPX4 signaling pathway, with genetic ablation of HIF-1α completely negating the compound's therapeutic efficacy. CONCLUSION: MYHD-NB mitigates ferroptosis triggered by DEX in BMSCs while enhancing osteogenic differentiation via the HIF-1α/GPX4 signaling pathway, elucidating its therapeutic mechanism against GIOP.

Although renal transplantation remains the only curative treatment for end-stage CKD, traditional Chinese herbal therapy has shown significant therapeutic benefits in its management. Kaempferol (KAE), a biologically active compound present in a wide range of foods and medicinal plants, has been demonstrated to possess antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and nephroprotective properties. This study aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms through which KAE exerts its therapeutic effects in CKD. Firstly, a CKD mouse model was established. Additionally, immunofluorescence labeling and western blotting were performed to elucidate the renoprotective mechanisms of KAE. To evaluate intracellular calcium dynamics in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), we performed dynamic calcium monitoring and patch-clamp electrophysiology. Network pharmacology analysis suggested the involvement of the hypoxia inducible factor 1 subunit alpha (HIF-1α) pathway in KAE's therapeutic effects on CKD. Through molecular docking analysis, it was shown that KAE could bind effectively to the Piezo1 protein. Furthermore, a co-culture system of mouse aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (MOVAS) and human kidney 2 (HK-2) cells were established to validate KAE's suppressive effects on the Piezo1/HIF-1α/ROS/NLRP3 cascade.

This study aimed to determine whether panaxadiol can inhibit immune evasion and, hence, have anti-cancer effects in ESCC. METHODS: Human ESCC cell lines (EC109 and EC9706) were exposed to 3 or 10 μM panaxadiol dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide. Colony formation and ethynyl deoxyuridine assays were performed to measure ESCC cell proliferation. After ESCC and CD8<sup>+</sup>T cell coculture, crystal violet staining and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) assays were used to detect ESCC cell viability and death. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was performed to measure the levels of inflammatory cytokines (interferon (IFN)-γ, interleukin (IL)-4, and IL-10). To establish a xenograft mouse model, 3 × 10<sup>5</sup> EC109 cells treated with or without panaxadiol were subcutaneously injected into mice. Western blotting was conducted to assess the protein expression of proliferation markers (cyclin D1, c-myc, and vascular endothelial growth factor), HIF-1α, programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1), and STAT3 phosphorylation in ESCC cells or mouse tumors. RESULTS: Both 3 and 10 μM panaxadiol significantly inhibited ESCC cell proliferation. After coculture with CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells, ESCC cell viability was markedly reduced, whereas IFN-γ, IL-10, and IL-4 levels were prominently elevated. LDH assays revealed that panaxadiol enhanced CD8<sup>+</sup>T cell-induced cytotoxicity toward ESCC cells. Moreover, panaxadiol effectively suppressed xenograft tumor growth in ESCC. The activities of STAT3, PD-L1, and HIF-1α in ESCC cells and mouse tumor tissues were significantly suppressed by panaxadiol.

After entry into hepatocytes, HBV RC-DNA is transported to the nucleus and converted into a covalently closed circular molecule cccDNA. The cccDNA is the template for transcription of all viral RNAs including the pregenomic RNA (pgRNA), encoding for 7 viral proteins: large, middle, and small envelope proteins (LHBs, MHBs, and SHBs) that form the surface antigen (HBsAg), the core antigen (HBcAg), the e antigen (HBeAg), the HBV polymerase, and the regulatory protein X (HBx). The pgRNA interacts with the viral polymerase protein to initiate the encapsidation into the core particles. Through endoplasmic reticulum, the core particles finish assembling with the envelope proteins and are released. HBV infection leads to a wide spectrum of liver diseases raging from chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis to hepatocellular carcinoma. The mechanism of liver injury is still not clear. However, HBV proteins target host proteins, involved in a variety of functions, thus regulating transcription, cellular signaling cascades, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.", "genes": ["100039786"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "41055213", "title": "Mitochondrial respiratory chain regulates HBV clearance through dual modulation of lysosomal acidification.", "abstract": "Mitochondria are vital for maintaining cellular homeostasis. However, mitochondrial damage is evident in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB). The role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the persistence of viral replication remains unclear. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the impact of mitochondrial dysfunction on HBV replication and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Both mitochondria and lysosomes were dysfunctional in HBV-replicating cells. Moreover, HBV replication inhibited mitochondrial respiratory chain both <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Moderate inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory complex I activity using rotenone (Rot) increased HBV replication and decreased autophagic degradation capacity <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Mechanistically, elevated mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) levels by Rot treatment or SOD2 knockdown led to deteriorated lysosomal membrane permeabilization, which elevated lysosomal pH and promoted HBV replication. Conversely, scavenging mtROS with mitoquinone (mitoQ) and mitoTEMPO (mitoT) had the opposite effect. Additionally, mitochondrial dysfunction reduced mitochondrial ATP production and diminished mitochondria-lysosome contacts. Obstructing mitochondrial ATP synthesis with Oligomycin A treatment or disruption of mitochondria-lysosome contacts with vacuolar protein sorting 13 A (VPS13A) knockdown resulted in lysosomal alkalinization and increased HBV replication by inhibiting vacuolar (H+)-adenosine triphosphatase (v-ATPase) assembly in an mtROS-independent manner. Ultimately, inhibition of mitochondrial complex I facilitated HBV secretion by promoting endosomal trafficking of HBV components.

The ubiquitin-proteasome system, central to protein degradation, cellular homeostasis, and cell cycle regulation, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several cancers, including HCC. Despite this, the specific expression patterns of proteasomal subunits during HBV infection and HBV-induced HCC, as well as the association between mRNA expression of proteasomal subunits and proteasomal activity, remain poorly defined. To address this critical knowledge gap, we analyzed mRNA expression profiles of proteasomal subunits in HBV-infected humanized mouse models to uncover HBV-specific molecular alterations. Our findings revealed that the chymotrypsin-like activity (β5) subunit of the proteasome (PSMB5) is consistently overexpressed following HBV infection. Functional studies demonstrated that β5 deficiency decreases MHC I levels on the cell surface and leads to the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, establishing a direct link between β5 overexpression and increased proteasomal activity. Concordantly, HBV-infected patient livers-regardless of HCC status-displayed elevated β5 mRNA/protein levels and enhanced chymotrypsin-like activity. Additionally, analysis of Protein Atlas data revealed that elevated β5 mRNA expression correlates with poor clinical prognosis in HCC patients. In summary, this study highlights how HBV infection induces significant alterations in proteasome function by elevating β5 expression and activity in human and mouse livers.

B virus (HBV) infection. However, the molecular mechanism underlying HBV-HCC are not yet fully understood. Here, we found that Kruppel-like factor 16 (KLF16) was significantly upregulated in HBV-HCC and KLF16 knockdown suppressed the growth and metastasis of HBV-infected HCC cells. Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx)-mediated N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification of KLF16 mRNA promoted the binding of insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 2 (IGF2BP2) and IGF2BP3, thereby enhancing the stability of KLF16 mRNA. Furthermore, KLF16 was found to promote the transcription of chromosome 12 open reading frame 49 (C12orf49), which in turn increased programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression by competitively binding to speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP) and blocking SPOP-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of PD-L1. HBx contributed to immune escape in HBV-HCC through the KLF16-C12orf49-PD-L1 axis. Importantly, inhibiting KLF16 significantly improved the efficacy of anti-PD-L1 therapy in HBV-HCC.

Melanogenesis is under complex regulatory control by multiple agents. The most important positive regulator of melanogenesis is the MC1 receptor with its ligands melanocortic peptides. MC1R activates the cyclic AMP (cAMP) response-element binding protein (CREB). Increased expression of MITF and its activation by phosphorylation (P) stimulate the transcription of tyrosinase (TYR), tyrosinase-related protein 1 (TYRP1), and dopachrome tautomerase (DCT), which produce melanin. Melanin synthesis takes place within specialized intracellular organelles named melanosomes.

Additionally, M1-polarized RAW264.7 macrophages were treated by laser to investigate inflammatory-mediator production and phagocytic capacity. LFQSNY laser irradiation significantly attenuated melanin production in cells via upregulating DHX9 and repressing TRIB3 through promoter binding, which emerged as a critical determinant of melanogenesis suppression. Furthermore, LFQSNY laser reduced the inflammatory factors and enhanced the phagocytic activity in macrophages, resulting in the anti-inflammatory activities and pigment-clearing.

At AJs, E-cadherin serves as an essential cell adhesion molecules (CAMs). The cytoplasmic tail binds beta-catenin, which in turn binds alpha-catenin. Alpha-catenin is associated with F-actin bundles directly and indirectly. The integrity of the cadherin-catenin complex is negatively regulated by phosphorylation of beta-catenin by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases (Fer, Fyn, Yes, and Src), which leads to dissociation of the cadherin-catenin complex. Integrity of this complex is positively regulated by beta -catenin phosphorylation by casein kinase II, and dephosphorylation by protein tyrosine phosphatases. Changes in the phosphorylation state of beta-catenin affect cell-cell adhesion, cell migration and the level of signaling beta-catenin. Wnt signaling acts as a positive regulator of beta-catenin by inhibiting beta-catenin degradation, which stabilizes beta-catenin, and causes its accumulation. Cadherin may acts as a negative regulator of signaling beta-catenin as it binds beta-catenin at the cell surface and thereby sequesters it from the nucleus. Nectins also function as CAMs at AJs, but are more highly concentrated at AJs than E-cadherin. Nectins transduce signals through Cdc42 and Rac, which reorganize the actin cytoskeleton, regulate the formation of AJs, and strengthen cell-cell adhesion.", "genes": ["108100"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "40741726", "title": "Piezo1 balances membrane and cortex tension to stabilize intercellular junctions and maintain the epithelial barrier.", "abstract": "Formation of the skin barrier is essential for organismal survival and tissue homeostasis.

Here, we show that the mechanosensitive ion channel Piezo1 is essential for the maturation of intercellular junctions into functional continuous adhesions. Deletion of Piezo1 results in an imbalance of cell contractility and membrane tension, leading to a delay in adhesion maturation. Consequently, the requirement for Piezo1 activity can be bypassed by lowering contractility or elevating membrane tension.

The gene product contains a central armadillo-repeat containing domain through which it binds the cytoplasmic tail of classical cadherins; meanwhile, it also binds alpha-catenin, which further links the cadherin complex to the actin cytoskeleton either directly or indirectly. Beta-catenin is therefore necessary for the adhesive function of classical cadherins. Another key function of this protein is to mediate the canonical Wnt signaling pathway and regulate gene transcription. Without Wnt signal, cytoplasmic beta-catenin that is not associated with the cadherin complex is quickly phosphorylated at the N-terminal Ser/Thr residues by the so called degradation complex containing axin, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), casein kinase I, and GSK3B, then ubiquitylated by beta-TrCP, and degraded by the proteasome. However, in the presence of Wnt signal, the degradation complex is disrupted and the stabilized cytoplasmic beta-catenin translocates into the nucleus, where it binds various transcription factors and, together with these factors, regulates the transcription of many downstream genes.

This highlights an important knowledge gap, as dysfunction of septins, and specifically septin 9 (SEPT9), is associated with intestinal pathologies. We determined that SEPT9 localizes to the apical junctions of intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), overlapping with both tight and adherens junctions. IEC-specific ablation of SEPT9 in mice resulted in leaky gut, due to mislocalization of junctional proteins, and increased susceptibility to experimental colitis. Consistently, SEPT9 expression was significantly reduced in intestinal mucosa of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Using affinity-purification mass spectrometry, super-resolution imaging, and genetic KO, we determined that SEPT9 interacts with and is necessary to recruit nonmuscle myosin IIC (NMIIC) to the IEC perijunctional actomyosin belt.

The gene product contains a central armadillo-repeat containing domain through which it binds the cytoplasmic tail of classical cadherins; meanwhile, it also binds alpha-catenin, which further links the cadherin complex to the actin cytoskeleton either directly or indirectly. Beta-catenin is therefore necessary for the adhesive function of classical cadherins. Another key function of this protein is to mediate the canonical Wnt signaling pathway and regulate gene transcription. Without Wnt signal, cytoplasmic beta-catenin that is not associated with the cadherin complex is quickly phosphorylated at the N-terminal Ser/Thr residues by the so called degradation complex containing axin, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), casein kinase I, and GSK3B, then ubiquitylated by beta-TrCP, and degraded by the proteasome. However, in the presence of Wnt signal, the degradation complex is disrupted and the stabilized cytoplasmic beta-catenin translocates into the nucleus, where it binds various transcription factors and, together with these factors, regulates the transcription of many downstream genes. Mutations of this gene have been linked with various types of tumors. Alternatively spliced variants have been found for this gene.

Although its loss of expression has been linked to breast cancer invasion and metastasis, the underlying mechanisms driving tumour progression upon mutational Afadin (AFDN) loss in breast cancers remains unclear. In the current study we identified a somatic frameshift AFDN mutation (p.Lys630fs) in an invasive breast cancer sample that coincides with loss of Afadin protein expression. Functional studies in E-cadherin-expressing breast cancer cells show that Afadin loss leads to immature and aberrant adherens junction (AJ) formation. The lack of AJ maturation results in a noncohesive cellular phenotype accompanied by Actomyosin-dependent anoikis resistance, which are classical progression hallmarks of single-cell breast cancer invasion. Reconstitution experiments using Afadin truncates show that proper F-actin organisation and epithelial cell-cell adhesion critically depend on the Coiled-Coil domain of Afadin but not on the designated C-terminal F-actin binding domain. Mouse xenograft experiments based on cell lines and primary patient-derived breast cancer organoids demonstrate that Afadin loss induces single-cell lobular-type invasion phenotypes and overt dissemination to the lungs and the peritoneum. In short, Afadin is a metastasis suppressor for breast cancer through stabilisation and maturation of a mechanical E-cadherin to F-actin outside-in link. © 2025 The Author(s).

PURPOSE: This study aims to investigate the effect of Ova on RF and its underlying mechanism. METHODS: Unilateral ischemia-reperfusion injury (UIRI) and unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) were intragastrically administrated by solvent (vehicle group) or Ova at two concentations (25 and 50 mg kg<sup>-1</sup> day<sup>-1</sup>) as treatment groups and telmisartan (Tel) as a positive control group. Mass spectrometry (MS), HuProt<sup>TM</sup> proteome microarray, surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays and molecular docking were utilized to explore the molecular mechanism by which Ova regulated metabolic reprogramming in renal tubular epithelial cells (RTECs). In vitro, RTECs were subjected to small interfering RNA (siRNA) and mutant plasmids to evaluate the role of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) in metabolic reprogramming. RESULTS: Ova treatment markedly attenuated RF in UIRI and UUO mice by suppressing pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) overactivation. Ova bound specifically to G6PD's Lys403 site, promoted its acetylation and thereby inhibited dimer formation and enzymatic activity without affecting overall protein expression. Notably, Ova effectively inhibited but did not completely abolish G6PD activity, thereby preserving basal PPP levels crucial for cellular survival and physiological functions.

In vivo, Th17 differentiation requires antigen presentation and co-stimulation, and activation of antigen presenting-cells (APCs) to produce TGF-beta, IL-6, IL-1, IL-23 and IL-21. This initial activation results in the activation and up-regulation of STAT3, ROR(gamma)t and other transcriptional factors in CD4+ T cells, which bind to the promoter regions of the IL-17, IL-21 and IL-22 genes and induce IL-17, IL-21 and IL-22. In contrast, the differentiation of Th17 cells and their IL-17 expression are negatively regulated by IL-2, Th2 cytokine IL-4, IL-27 and Th1 cytokine IFN-gamma through STAT5, STAT6 and STAT1 activation, respectively. Retinoid acid and the combination of IL-2 and TGF-beta upregulate Foxp3, which also downregulates cytokines like IL-17 and IL-21.

Shifts in the microbiome caused by antibiotic exposure can modulate immune activity through various pathways. Therefore, we aimed to explore how antibiotics affect immune-inflammation by regulating Th17 cells through the gut microbiota of mice with experimental autoimmune prostatitis (EAP). Antibiotic-driven shifts in gut microbial communities and metabolite profiling in EAP mice were performed by integrating 16S rRNA sequencing with mass spectrometry-driven metabolomic analysis. Antibiotic cocktail (ABX) therapy mitigated EAP, modified the gut microbiome composition, and influenced bile acid metabolism. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) using microbiota from ABX-treated feces into EAP mice effectively altered gut microbiome composition and alleviated disease symptoms, indicating that microbiome intervention reduces autoimmune inflammation and decreases deoxycholic acid (DCA) in mice. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that DCA suppresses farnesol X receptor (FXR) expression which can inhibit the NLRP3‒ IL17A axis, thus promoting Th17 cell development and exacerbating inflammatory cell infiltration of the prostate. Our initial clinical examination of patients with prostatitis and antibiotic treatment indicated that bile acid metabolism and Th17 cell development are affected by antibiotic therapy.

Conditioned medium derived from stem cells of human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED-CM) exhibits considerable immunomodulatory and regenerative effects. We evaluated the efficacy of SHED-CM in an AD-like mouse model and explored the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Mice with ovalbumin (OVA)-specific allergic dermatitis (OSAD) were intravenously treated with SHED-CM, conditioned medium derived from fibroblast, or Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium, followed by antigen restimulation to induce AD-like dermatitis. Disease severity was assessed macroscopically and histologically. T cell phenotypes were analyzed using immunohistochemical staining, RT-qPCR, and flow cytometry. Total serum and OVA-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels were measured using ELISA. Naïve splenic CD4⁺ T cells were activated using CD3/CD28 beads in SHED-CM to evaluate their direct effects on T cell differentiation through flow cytometry. Highly expressed proteins in SHED-CM were identified using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and neutralizing antibodies were used to elucidate the therapeutic mechanisms. RESULTS: The treatment with SHED-CM significantly ameliorated AD-like symptoms, reduced epidermal hyperplasia, and restored filaggrin expression. SHED-CM created an anti-inflammatory microenvironment in OSAD skin and draining lymph nodes by promoting Treg differentiation and inhibiting Th2 and Th17 populations. SHED-CM markedly suppressed B cell maturation, antigen-specific IgE production, and mast cell activation. Furthermore, we found that SHED-CM directly promoted Treg differentiation from naïve CD4⁺ T cells stimulated by CD3/CD28, which was mediated, in part, through TGFβ contained in SHED-CM. SHED-CM exhibited little to no effect on in vitro Th1, Th2, and Th17 differentiation.

Zhilining Formula (ZLN), a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), shows clinical efficacy in UC, yet its core material basis and precise mechanisms remain obscure. PURPOSE: To identify bioactive constituents and molecular targets of ZLN, and to uncover the pharmacological mechanisms underlying its anti-UC effects. METHODS: DSS and TNBS-induced colitis models were established to assess ZLN's efficacy. Network pharmacology, KEGG/GO enrichment, Machine learning and Mendelian randomization were employed to identify core targets and pathways. IL-17A neutralization and AAV9-Stat3 were employed to validate involvement of Th17 cell differentiation and STAT3 signaling in ZLN's therapeutic effects. UHPLC-MS/MS was utilized to characterize chemical composition of ZLN, and surface plasmon resonance assay was applied to confirm direct interactions between core compounds and STAT3. RESULTS: ZLN significantly alleviated DSS and TNBS-induced colitis. Network pharmacology identified 65 active compounds, 864 potential targets, and 2826 UC-related genes, with 275 overlapping targets as key mediators of ZLN's effects. Enrichment analysis and IL-17A neutralization highlighted Th17 cell differentiation as a central pathway. Machine learning and Mendelian randomization identified STAT3 as a crucial target. Mechanistically, ZLN inhibited Th17 cell differentiation by blocking STAT3 activation. Four core constituents including andrographin, panicolin, wogonin, and luteolin directly bound to STAT3, contributing to Th17 inhibition and therapeutic efficacy.

PKA modulates, via phosphorylation, a number of cellular substrates, including transcription factors, ion channels, transporters, exchangers, intracellular Ca2+ -handling proteins, and the contractile machinery.

This TI-Treg gene expression signature is conserved in TI-Tregs across species and tumor types and stages, suggesting the presence of a common inducing mechanism in the tumor microenvironment (TME).

Despite advances in supportive care, targeted therapies remain limited. Given the critical role of cAMP signaling in immune regulation and cellular homeostasis, this study explored the therapeutic potential of dipyridamole, a phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor, mitigating SA-AKI. METHODS: Transcriptomic profiling of kidneys from LPS-induced SA-AKI and control mice was performed to identify dysregulated pathways. The effects of dipyridamole on renal pathology and function were evaluated using biochemical assays, PAS staining, TUNEL staining, electron microscopy, and immunohistochemistry. Mechanistic studies included ELISA, qPCR, western blotting, molecular docking, and PDE12 knockdown in TCMK-1 cells with siRNA transfection. RESULTS: Transcriptomic analysis revealed widespread dysfunction of inflammatory and metabolic pathways in SA-AKI kidneys, with upregulation of NF-κB/TLR signaling and suppression of cAMP-related pathways. Among PDE isoforms, PDE12 was most significantly upregulated, and molecular docking demonstrated strong binding of dipyridamole to PDE12. Dipyridamole treatment restored cAMP levels, enhanced CREB phosphorylation, suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6), and attenuated necroptosis via inhibition of RIPK3/MLKL signaling. Importantly, siRNA-mediated PDE12 knockdown reproduced these protective effects, confirming PDE12 as a pathogenic mediator of LPS-induced tubular injury. These molecular and cellular changes translated into significant improvements in renal function and histological integrity. CONCLUSIONS: Dipyridamole alleviates SA-AKI by targeting PDE12, restoring cAMP signaling, and suppressing inflammation and necroptosis.

Jianwei Shoutai Pills (JSP), a classical prescription of Chinese medicine, have been widely used in the treatment of RPL. However, the effective components and mechanisms of JSP haven't been sufficiently illustrated. PURPOSE: To explore the effective components and mechanisms of JSP in treating RPL. METHODS: Effects of JSP on PRL were evaluated in CBA/J × DBA/2 mice model with pregnancy loss rates, morphology of placenta and embryos, as well as hormone levels. Then effective component was identified according to JSP components, plasma and placenta JSP-derived components analyzed by ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) and Chinmedomics. Furthermore, the effects of the active component were evaluated using the CBA/J × DBA/2 mouse model. Its potential mechanism of action was predicted through network pharmacology and molecular docking, and subsequently validated by surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and western blot analysis. RESULTS: JSP could well alleviate RPL in the CBA/J × DBA/2 mice model. Moreover, combining with JSP components, plasma and placenta JSP-derived components analysis, sweroside was the only overlapped component and considered as the effective component of JSP according to the good effects on RPL mice model. Network pharmacology identified 83 targets as the hub targets of sweroside in the treatment of RPL, and most genes were enriched in cAMP signaling pathway. SPR analysis indicated that sweroside is capable of binding to the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. Subsequently, western blot results demonstrated a significant upregulation of proteins enriched in the cAMP signaling pathway following sweroside administration, suggesting the activation of this pathway.

One of the mechanisms of neutrophil action is the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), the extracellular structures composed of chromatin coated with histones, proteases and granular and cytosolic proteins that help catch and kill microorganisms. NETs are formed by a process known as \"NETosis\" that can be triggered by microorganisms and endogenous stimuli, such as damage-associated molecular patterns and immune complexes, and involves activation in most cases of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-oxidase, which produces reactive oxygen species (ROS). Recent study has reported that there are two different mechanisms of NETosis, including a lytic NETosis and a vital NETosis. Lytic NETosis begins with nuclear delobulation and the disassembly of the nuclear envelope and continues with loss of cellular polarization, chromatin decondensation and plasma membrane rupture. Vital NETosis can occur independently of cell death and involves the secreted expulsion of nuclear chromatin that is accompanied by the release of granule proteins through degranulation.", "genes": ["100039319"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "41057887", "title": "Neutrophil extracellular trapping network-associated biomarkers in liver fibrosis: machine learning and experimental validation.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The diagnostic and therapeutic potential of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in liver fibrosis (LF) has not been fully explored.

Enrichment analysis and protein interaction analysis were used to reveal the candidate genes and potential mechanisms of NETs-related liver fibrosis. Biomarkers were screened using SVM-RFE and Boruta machine learning algorithms, followed by immune infiltration analysis.

Finally, the molecular regulatory network and potential drugs of biomarkers were predicted. RESULTS: A total of 166 NETs-DEGs were identified. Through enrichment analysis, these genes were mainly enriched in chemokine signaling pathway and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway. Machine learning screened CCL2 as a NETs-related liver fibrosis biomarker, involved in ribosome-related processes, cell cycle regulation and allograft rejection pathways. Immune infiltration analysis showed that there were significant differences in 22 immune cell subtypes between fibrotic samples and healthy samples, including neutrophils mainly related to NETs production.

During sepsis, inflammation-related immunosuppression is the critical factor causing secondary infection and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. The regulatory mechanisms underlying Treg differentiation and function, which significantly contribute to septic immunosuppression, require further clarification. In this study, we found that neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) participated in the development of sepsis-induced immunosuppression by enhancing Treg differentiation and function via direct interaction with CD4+ T cells. Briefly, NETs anchored enolase 1 (ENO1) on the membrane of CD4+ T cells through its key protein myeloperoxidase (MPO) and subsequently recruited interferon-induced transmembrane protein 2 (IFITM2). IFITM2 acted as a DNA receptor that sensed NET-DNA and activated intracellular RAS-associated protein 1B (RAP1B) and its downstream ERK signaling pathway to promote Treg differentiation and function. ENO1 inhibition significantly attenuated NET-induced Treg differentiation and alleviated sepsis in mice. Overall, we demonstrated the role of NETs in sepsis-induced immunosuppression by enhancing Treg differentiation, identified ENO1 as an anchor of NET-MPO, and elucidated the downstream molecular mechanism by which IFITM2-RAP1B-ERK regulates Treg differentiation.

Its specific role in traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains poorly defined. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which accumulate at injury sites in TBI models, are linked to poor outcomes, yet the connection between NETs and neddylation remains unclear. <b>Methods:</b> We analyzed contused brain tissues from TBI patients and mice subjected to controlled cortical impact (CCI) using Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and immunohistochemistry.

{"id": "mmu05417", "name": "Lipid and atherosclerosis - Mus musculus (house mouse)", "description": "Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease marked by a narrowing of the arteries from lipid-rich plaques present within the walls of arterial blood vessels. It represents the root cause of the majority of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and their complications, including conditions such as coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction and stroke.  An elevated level of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol constitutes a major risk factor for genesis of atherosclerosis. LDL can accumulate within the blood vessel wall and undergo modification by oxidation. Oxidized LDL (oxLDL) leads to endothelial dysfunction leading to expression of adhesion molecules and recruitment of monocyte in subendothelial space. The monocytes proliferate, differentiate into macrophages, and take up the lipoproteins, forming cholesterol-engorged \"foam cells.\" With the time, the foam cells die, leaving a 'necrotic core' of crystalline cholesterol and cell debris. Smooth muscle cells proliferate and migrate into the region, laying down a protective cap over the lesion. Lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1), which mediates the recognition and internalization of oxLDL, is involved in all of these events critical in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.", "genes": ["100066"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "41236634", "title": "LPCAT3-dependent remodeling of the phospholipids and lipid rafts is essential for vascular proinflammatory signaling and the development of atherosclerosis.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Lysophosphatidyl choline acyltransferase 3 (LPCAT3) is crucially involved in the remodeling of phospholipids in the membranes through incorporation of arachidonic acid (ARA; 20:4). The ARA-derived eicosanoids aggravate leukocyte adhesion, inflammation, vascular dysfunction, thrombosis, and atherogenesis. This study found that LPCAT3 modulates lipid rafts and contributes to the raft assembly/organization essential for cytokine signaling. METHODS: RNAi-dependent silencing of LPCAT3 in the endothelial cells. EPA and DHA enrichment in the cells. Lipid raft isolation and analysis of proinflammatory signaling molecules. Diet-induced atherosclerosis in the mice. LPCAT3 siRNA lipid nanoparticles/ EPA, DHA therapy. RESULTS: RNAi-dependent silencing of LPCAT3 inhibits TNFα-induced translocation & ubiquitination of TNFR1-signaling complex into the lipid rafts. This is associated with the attenuated NF-κB activation, synthesis of cell-adhesion molecules, cytokines, leukocyte adhesion, vascular permeability and endothelial dysfunction. Intriguingly, LPCAT3 inhibition resulted in significantly greater accretion of EPA and DHA in the PC and PE at the expense of ARA, and potentially decreased the ARA-derived eicosanoids in the vascular endothelium. Therapeutic administration of LPCAT3 siRNA-lipid nanoparticles in the high fat fed- mice markedly lowered the plasma glucose, insulin, proinflammatory cytokines, eicosanoids, and attenuated the plaque formation in the aorta. Co-treatment of LPCAT3 siRNA-lipid nanoparticles with EPA/DHA significantly elevated the accretion of EPA/DHA levels in the heart tissues and nullified the plaque development in the mice.

GVHD pathophysiology can be summerized in a three-step process. Step 1 involves the development of an inflammatory milieu resulting from damage in the host tissues induced by the preparative chemotherapy or radiotherapy regimen. Damaged tissues secrete inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin 1 (IL-1), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha ). During step 2, antigen-presenting cells (APCs) trigger the activation of donor-derived T cells, which induce further T-cell expansion, induce cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and natural killer (NK) cells responses and prime additional mononuclear phagocytes to produce TNF-alpha and IL-1. Also, nitric oxide (NO) is produced by activated macrophages, and it may contribute to the tissue damage seen during step 3.

A large majority (≥16) of the outcome variables identified significant differences in the two phenotypes, many with very large effect sizes. In acute GVHD, B cells exhibited the greatest degree of depletion in both sexes; however, the male response was significantly stronger. Sex differences in chronic GVHD were more widespread; females exhibited significantly greater numbers of total splenocytes and host CD4 T cells, Tfh cells, B cells and CD8 T cells consistent with greater female autoantibody production in this model. The more potent male CTL response in acute GVHD conflicts with reports of greater female CTL responses following infections or vaccines possibly reflecting the absence of exogenous innate immune stimuli in the GVHD model.

Here we assessed whether gain or loss of GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) signaling modifies the extent of gut injury and inflammation in experimental murine acute graft vs. host disease (aGvHD). METHODS: Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) was performed using bone marrow and splenocytes from BALB/c donors to induce aGvHD in C57BL/6 recipients or vice versa. Chimerism was determined by flow cytometry analysis of immune cell compartments. Inflammation was assessed by histological scoring of gut mucosal damage and by measuring circulating cytokine levels. qPCR was used to quantify gene expression in small intestine immune cells and tissues. The gut microbiome was assessed by 16S rRNA sequencing. RESULTS: Allogeneic chimerism was greater than 90% in peripheral blood and in the gut epithelial compartment. Levels of Glp1r mRNA transcripts were induced in the ileum of both vehicle- and semaglutide-treated allogeneic mice, reflecting that allogeneic T cells homing to the gut express a functional GLP-1R. Nevertheless, semaglutide did not attenuate the severity of systemic cytokine induction, gut injury or inflammation, or the extent of aGvHD in the gut mucosa. Loss of GLP-1R signaling in donor cells had limited effects on overall microbial diversity during acute GvHD, and semaglutide-treated mice exhibited modest changes in proportions of microbial species.

Each MAPKK, however, can be activated by more than one MAPKKK, increasing the complexity and diversity of MAPK signalling. Presumably each MAPKKK confers responsiveness to distinct stimuli.

Mitochondrial stomatin‑like protein 2 (STOML2), which is upregulated in various solid tumors, is associated with a poor prognosis; however, its biological function and molecular mechanism in HCC remain unclear. The present study aimed to elucidate the oncogenic mechanism of STOML2 in HCC and to explore its potential as a therapeutic target. Firstly, STOML2 expression in HCC and matched normal liver tissues was analyzed. In addition, STOML2‑knockdown (HCCLM3‑short hairpin RNA‑STOML2) and ‑overexpression (Huh7‑STOML2) cell models were established. Wound healing, Cell Counting Kit‑8 and Transwell assays, and flow cytometry were performed to assess cell proliferation, invasion, migration and apoptosis <i>in vitro</i>. Furthermore, the biological function of STOML2 was confirmed in vivo. Co‑immunoprecipitation (co‑IP) and immunofluorescence staining were conducted to validate the interaction of STOML2 with prohibitin (PHB) following the prediction of binding partners. Downstream pathways regulated by STOML2 were identified using western blotting and were further investigated using the RAF1 inhibitor sorafenib. The present study revealed that STOML2 expression was significantly upregulated in HCC tissues and metastatic lesions, and was associated with poor patient prognosis. The <i>in vitro</i> experiments showed that STOML2 overexpression promoted proliferation, invasion, migration and autophagy, while inhibiting apoptosis in Huh7 cells. Conversely, STOML2 knockdown reversed these phenotypic changes. Furthermore, co‑IP confirmed the direct interaction between STOML2 and PHB, which activated the RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathway. The <i>in vivo</i> experiments further confirmed that STOML2 overexpression significantly accelerated tumor growth, whereas STOML2 or PHB knockdown inhibited tumor progression. In addition, sorafenib treatment suppressed STOML2‑mediated cell migration and the expression of autophagy‑related proteins by blocking the MAPK pathway.

PURPOSE: To investigate liquiritin's therapeutic effects on PMOP and its underlying mechanisms, constituting the first comprehensive investigation of its role in osteoclasts regulation and apoptosis induction within PMOP pathophysiology. METHODS: Network pharmacology was employed to predict potential targets of Liquiritin in PMOP. The CCK-8 assay assessed its effect on bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) viability. RANKL was used to induce BMDMs differentiation into mature osteoclasts. TRAcP and F-actin staining detected osteoclasts formation; bone resorption assays evaluated functionality. Western blotting and immunofluorescence were applied to evaluate osteoclasts-related proteins, MAPK/NF-κB pathway activity, and apoptosis. Notably, molecular docking predicted Liquiritin's binding to PPARγ, validated by CETSA. An OVX-induced PMOP mouse model was constructed in vivo; bone microarchitecture and osteoclasts activity were evaluated using micro-CT, H&E, and TRAcP staining. RESULTS: Liquiritin suppressed osteoclasts formation and bone resorption in vitroand mitigated bone loss in vivo by downregulating osteoclasts-specific genes, inhibiting MAPK/NF-κB pathways, and most importantly, inducing PPARγ-mediated apoptosis-a novel mechanistic insight not previously reported.

The functional mechanism of ADAR1 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains incompletely understood. This study aimed to investigate the prognostic significance of ADAR1 in NSCLC and to elucidate its potential role in regulating tumor cell proliferation and migration. METHODS: Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and cBioPortal were analyzed to assess the correlation between high ADAR1 expression and clinicopathological features as well as prognosis in lung cancer. We performed Western blot (WB), cell proliferation assays, Transwell invasion/migration assays, and nude mouse xenograft modeling to examine the phenotypic changes and molecular mechanisms induced by ADAR1 knockdown. Furthermore, the ADAR1 p150 overexpression model was utilized to validate the proposed mechanism. RESULTS: ADAR1 expression was significantly elevated in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC) tissues compared with adjacent non-tumor tissues (LUAD: P=3.70×10-15, LUSC: P=0.016). High ADAR1 expression was associated with poor prognosis (LUAD: P=2.03×10-2, LUSC: P=2.81×10-2) and distant metastasis (P=0.003). Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) indicated that elevated ADAR1 was associated with mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathway activation, matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) expression, and cell adhesion. ADAR1 and MMP-9 levels showed a strongly positive correlation (P=6.45×10-34) in 10 lung cancer cell lines, highest in H1581. Knockdown of ADAR1 in H1581 cells induced a rounded cellular morphology with reduced pseudopodia. Concomitantly, it suppressed cell proliferation, invasion, migration, and in vivo tumorigenesis. It also suppressed ERK phosphorylation and downregulated cellular Finkel-Biskis-Jinkins murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog (c-FOS), MMP-9, N-cadherin, and Vimentin. Conversely, ADAR1 p150 overexpression in PC9 cells enhanced ERK phosphorylation and increased c-FOS and MMP-9 expression.

Over 40 genetically defined SCA subtypes have been identified, arising from mechanisms such as cytosine-adenine-guanine (CAG) trinucleotide repeat expansions, point mutations, and gene deletions. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 14 (SCA14) stems from mutations to the protein kinase C gamma (<i>PRKCG</i>) gene, which codes for protein kinase C gamma (PKCγ), a signaling protein predominantly expressed in cerebellar Purkinje cells. Although the genetic basis of SCA14 is well established, the mechanisms driving Purkinje cell dysfunction remain poorly understood. Notably, transgenic mice expressing the common PKCγ-Gly118Asp (G118D) mutation, located in the protein's regulatory domain, do not exhibit an overt disease phenotype, raising questions about potential compensatory changes at the molecular level. METHODS: We examined the expression of regulator of G protein signaling 8 (Rgs8), a molecule implicated in SCA-related pathways. Organotypic slice cultures and primary cerebellar cell cultures were generated <i>in vitro</i> to assess Purkinje cells from the non-manifesting PKCγ-G118D transgenic mouse line. RESULTS: A significant increase in Rgs8 expression was observed in both slice cultures and primary cerebellar cell cultures derived from the non-manifesting SCA14 mouse line.

Despite typically late onset and slow progression, the molecular basis of age-related decline remains unclear. We used a somatic in vivo approach to express wild-type (WT) PKCγ-GFP or the prototypical G128D PKCγ-GFP selectively in PCs of neonatal mice via an adeno-associated virus (AAV) under a PC-specific promoter. G128D PKCγ-GFP formed cytoplasmic aggregates, mislocalized PCs during development, and produced gait deficits by 4 weeks that worsened with age, despite preserved PC counts and overall cerebellar volume at 1.5 years. Immunohistochemistry revealed a selective vulnerability of climbing-fiber (CF) input: vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2), a marker of CF synapses, declined significantly from 12 to 60 weeks in G128D mice, and the VGLUT2-positive innervation field was narrower than age-matched WT at both time points. By contrast, the glutamate/aspartate transporter GLAST in Bergmann-glial radial processes was reduced predominantly at 12 weeks in G128D mice. The δ2 glutamate receptor (GluD2) at parallel fibers and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) decreased with age but were comparable between expression conditions. Notably, aggregated mutant PKCγ accumulated within the axon initial segment (AIS), whose architecture progressively deteriorated; the altered AIS excluded PKCγ-GFP from distal axons and, by 60 weeks, was associated with reduced delivery of the vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) to deep cerebellar nuclei (DCN), consistent with impaired anterograde transport. Hence, rather than overt neuronal loss, the cumulative burden of G128D-specific CF/axonal deficits and age-accentuated circuit and glial changes-reduced GLAST function and decreased GluD2-accounts for the worsening motor phenotype.

Primary disease events can be compensated transiently, delaying disease manifestation. To define potential therapy targets, here we studied how cells modify phosphoprotein signals, using preferentially affected nervous tissue from end-stage Atxn2-CAG100-Knockin mice. The spinal cord phosphoproteome revealed massive hyperphosphorylations flanking the polyQ expansion in ATXN2 and for SQSTM1 and moderate hyperphosphorylations also for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis proteins, OPTN (optineurin), UBQLN2 (ubiquilin-2), TNIP1 (TNFAIP3 interacting protein 1), and TBK1-targeted TAX1BP1. Conversely, strong hypophosphorylations of WNK1 (protein kinase with no lysine 1), SPARCL1 (secreted protein acidic and cysteine rich-like 1), and PSMD9 (proteasome 19S regulator non-ATPase assembly chaperone P27) were found. Significant enrichments of SRC-homology domain type 3-containing proteins, autophagy/endocytosis factors, and actin modulators could be explained by N-terminal, polyQ-adjacent, proline-rich motifs in ATXN2, suggesting that spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 pathogenesis is highly similar to Huntington's disease, where neurotoxicity is mediated by abnormal polyQ-proline-rich motif-SRC-homology domain type 3 interactions. Validation of protein and mRNA levels was done in mouse spinal cord and embryonic fibroblasts or patient fibroblasts after bafilomycin or arsenite treatment, observing polyQ-dependent OPTN deficiency and SQSTM1 induction impairment.

type 3 (SCA3) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder that belongs to the family of polyglutamine disorders. Although the CAG repeat expansion underlying SCA3 was discovered 30 years ago, there is still no cure or treatment able to delay its progression. One of the reasons for this lag may be attributed to the phenotypic and neuropathological heterogeneity among individuals. To overcome this gap, we aimed to delve into the specific contributions of hindbrain regions that have been consistently reported to be the most degenerated in SCA3 patients, the cerebellar cortex, namely lobules IV-V, VIII and IX, deep cerebellar nuclei and the pons. For this purpose, we used lentiviral vectors to deliver the SCA3-causing gene, mutant Ataxin-3, to these specific regions in mice. We observed that the overexpression of mutant Ataxin-3 in different hindbrain regions led to the formation of Ataxin-3 aggregates in neuronal cells and mild motor impairments. Neurons in the pons were more vulnerable to mutant Ataxin-3 overexpression than in the cerebellum. There was also an increase in astrocytes and microglia recruitment that may explain myelin damage and, consequently, white matter loss in the cerebellum. Indeed, cerebellar white matter loss was the most broadly observed pathological feature upon overexpression of mutant Ataxin-3 in different regions of the hindbrain.

Patients with MJD exhibit a wide range of clinical symptoms, including motor incoordination. Emerging evidence highlights circadian rhythm disruptions as early indicators and potential risk factors for the progression of neurodegenerative conditions. Circadian rhythms are regulated by internal clocks, with the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) acting as the master pacemaker to synchronize timing across the body's behavioural and physiological functions. While sleep disturbances have been observed in MJD, the role of clock regulation in its pathophysiology remains largely unexplored in spinocerebellar ataxias. This study aimed to investigate circadian rhythms, characterize associated disruptions and uncover the mechanisms underlying clock dysregulation in patients and preclinical models of MJD. Circadian activity in MJD patients was assessed over 2 weeks using actigraphy, while in a YAC-MJD transgenic mouse model, circadian rhythms were examined through: (i) wheel-running experiments; (ii) telemetry-based monitoring of core body temperature; (iii) immunohistochemical analysis of the neuropeptides arginine vasopressin (AVP) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) in the SCN and paraventricular nucleus (PVN); and (iv) quantitative real-time PCR evaluation of clock gene expression in the cerebellum. The impact of mutATXN3 on clock mechanisms was further investigated using Bmal1/Per2-luciferase reporters. MJD patients exhibited a progressive decline in robustness of behavioural rhythms, demonstrated by negative correlations between the circadian function index, rest-activity fragmentation and sleep efficiency with MJD clinical scales. YAC-MJD mice exhibited reduced activity levels and increased behavioural fragmentation, and they required three additional days to re-entrain after a jet lag protocol compared to controls. Disrupted core body temperature rhythms were observed, including a phase advance and elevated temperature (∼1°C) at the onset of the active period. Furthermore, transgenic mice showed reduced levels of VIP and AVP in the SCN and PVN and decreased clock gene expression in the cerebellum. Lastly, we found new mechanistic evidence that wild-type ATXN3 activates the promoters of Bmal1 and Per2, whereas mutATXN3 loses the capacity to drive Per2 upon polyglutamine expansion. Overall, our findings indicate that central clock dysfunction in MJD is associated with impaired clock gene expression and disruptions in activity and temperature rhythms. This study provides the first robust evidence of circadian rhythm dysregulation and underlying mechanisms in MJD, paving the way for identifying new biomarkers and developing novel circadian-based interventions to tackle MJD and possibly other spinocerebellar ataxias.", "authors": "Ribeiro RFN; Pereira D; Lopes SM; Reis T; Silva P; Lobo DD; Gaspar LS; Durães J; Fernandes AR; Ferreira-Marques M; Carvalhas-Almeida C; Peça J; Álvaro AR; Santana I; Santana MM; Silva MMC; Pereira de Almeida L; Cavadas C", "fulltext_url": "https://doi.org/10.1093/brain/awaf199", "keywords": "Spinocerebellar ataxia[MeSH Terms] AND mouse[MeSH Terms]", "llm_relevance_assessment": {"relevance_score": 8, "relevance_level": "High", "species_check": "The pathway is in Mus musculus (mouse), and the study uses a YAC-MJD transgenic mouse model, making it a valid model organism for the pathway.", "evidence_summary": ["This study aimed to investigate circadian rhythms, characterize associated disruptions and uncover the mechanisms underlying clock dysregulation in patients and preclinical models of MJD.", "Transgenic mice showed reduced levels of VIP and AVP in the SCN and PVN and decreased clock gene expression in the cerebellum."], "reasoning": "The study directly investigates circadian rhythm disruptions in Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), which is a subtype of spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA), the focus of the KEGG pathway.

The unstable expansion of CAG repeats disrupts the genetic stability of animal models, which is detrimental to disease research. METHODS: In this study, we established a mouse model in which CAG repeats do not undergo microsatellite instability (MSI) across generations. A humanized ATXN2 cDNA with four CAA interruptions within 73 CAG expansions was inserted into the Rosa26 locus of C57BL/6J mice. A 23 CAG control mouse model was also generated to verify ATXN2 integration and expression. RESULTS: In our model, the number of CAG repeats remained stable during transmission, with no CAG repeat expansion observed in 64 parent-to-offspring transmissions. Compared with SCA2-Q23 mice, SCA2-Q73 mice exhibited progressive motor impairment, reduced Purkinje cell count and volume (indicative of cell atrophy), and muscle atrophy. These observations in the mice suggest that the behavioral and neuropathological phenotypes may reflect the features of SCA2 patients. RNA-seq analysis of the gastrocnemius muscle in SCA2-Q73 mice showed significant changes in muscle differentiation and development gene expression at 56 weeks, with no significant differences at 16 weeks compared to SCA2-Q23 mice. The expression level of the Myf6 gene significantly changed in the muscles of aged mice.

SCA51 is caused by polyQ expansion in THAP domain containing 11 (THAP11), an essential transcription factor for brain development. The pathogenesis of SCA51, particularly how mutant THAP11 with polyQ expansion contributes to neuropathology, remains elusive. Our study of mouse and monkey brains revealed that THAP11 expression is subject to developmental regulation, showing enrichment in the cerebellum. However, knocking down endogenous THAP11 in adult mice did not affect neuronal survival. In contrast, expressing mutant THAP11 with polyQ expansion led to pronounced protein aggregation, cerebellar neurodegeneration, and motor deficits, indicating that gain-of-function mechanisms are central to SCA51 pathogenesis.

(ICA), a flavonoid glycoside from Epimedium brevicornu Maxim, has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for cardiovascular and metabolic disorders. While its effects on tonifying kidney yang and treating age-related conditions are well-documented, the underlying mechanisms, particularly in diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM), are not fully understood, especially regarding oxidative stress and mitochondrial function. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study sought to examine the cardioprotective effects of ICA on DCM and to clarify whether these effects are mediated through the Nrf2-dependent antioxidant and mitochondrial pathways. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We employed an integrative strategy combining network pharmacology, molecular docking (MD), and experimental validation. ICA-Nrf2 binding was assessed by MD and 100 ns. In vivo, diabetic mice induced by streptozotocin (STZ) and high-fat diet were treated with varying doses of ICA treatment, with or without the Nrf2 inhibitor ML385. Cardiac function, histopathology, mitochondrial morphology, and oxidative markers were evaluated. In vitro, HL-1 and primary mouse cardiomyocytes were exposed to high glucose (HG) and treated with ICA and/or Nrf2 overexpression. Antioxidant signaling, Western blotting, qRT-PCR, immunofluorescence, and biochemical assays were employed to evaluate mitochondrial function and ROS levels. RESULTS: ICA dose-dependently improved cardiac function and alleviated myocardial hypertrophy and fibrosis in DCM mice. It increased Nrf2 expression levels, upregulated HO-1, SOD2, PGC1-α, and TOM20, enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity, and suppressed ROS and MDA accumulation. In vitro, ICA reduced oxidative stress, preserved mitochondrial integrity, and decreased cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Network pharmacology and in silico modeling identified Nrf2 as a core ICA target, with stable ICA-Nrf2 binding confirmed by dynamics simulation. Notably, Nrf2 inhibition by ML385 partially reversed ICA's cardioprotective and mitochondrial effects, confirming the Nrf2-dependence of ICA's action. CONCLUSIONS: ICA confers potent cardioprotection against DCM by directly activating Nrf2 signaling, enhancing mitochondrial antioxidant defense, and attenuating oxidative stress-induced myocardial injury.

underlying PDZK1-mediated regulation of cardiac fibroblast (CF) activation and cardiac fibrosis in diabetic cardiomyopathy (DCM). MATERIALS AND METHODS: DCM models were constructed using db/db mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD) and C57BL/6 mice induced by multiple low-dose streptozotocin (STZ) combined with HFD. PDZK1 expression in myocardial tissues was detected via molecular assays; cardiac function was evaluated using echocardiography, and cardiac fibrosis was assessed by histopathological staining. The effects of PDZK1 knockout and overexpression on cardiac dysfunction and fibrosis were systematically evaluated, and the molecular interaction between PDZK1 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was explored through co-immunoprecipitation and phosphorylation analysis. KEY FINDINGS: PDZK1 expression was significantly downregulated in myocardial tissues of DCM mice compared with controls. PDZK1 knockout further aggravated STZ/HFD-induced cardiac dysfunction and excessive cardiac fibrosis, whereas PDZK1 overexpression markedly ameliorated these pathological changes in diabetic mice. Mechanistically, PDZK1 specifically interacted with the carboxyl terminus of EGFR via its PDZ1 and PDZ3 domains, thereby inhibiting EGFR phosphorylation at critical tyrosine residues and subsequent activation of downstream Akt signaling, which in turn suppressed CF activation and extracellular matrix deposition. This novel PDZK1-EGFR interaction in the context of DCM is reported for the first time.

Ligand binding to the four closely related members of this RTK family -epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, also known as ErbB-1 or HER1), ErbB-2 (HER2), ErbB-3 (HER3), and ErbB-4 (HER4)-induces the formation of receptor homo- and heterodimers and the activation of the intrinsic kinase domain, resulting in phosphorylation on specific tyrosine residues (pY) within the cytoplasmic tail. Signaling effectors containing binding pockets for pY-containing peptides are recruited to activated receptors and induce the various signaling pathways. The Shc- and/or Grb2-activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is a common target downstream of all ErbB receptors. Similarly, the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI-3K) pathway is directly or indirectly activated by most ErbBs.

This study examined the role of the Fer tyrosine kinase in sperm fertilizing activity. Inhibition of the Fer activity led to a 75% reduction in IVF rates in mice, indicating a critical role for Fer in fertilization. Further investigation of Fer's role during sperm capacitation focused on its potential interaction with the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). Inhibition of Fer during capacitation significantly decreased the EGFR activation state and increased the incidence of SAR, whereas inhibition of Fer during the acrosome reaction step had no effect on the EGF-induced AR.

are two intrinsic mechanisms that typically control fibrosis. The intracellular molecules that regulate these two pathways remain unclear. Here, we investigated how EGFR and YAP signalling control retinal Müller cell-related diabetic retinal fibrosis in vivo and in vitro. METHODS: Human retinal Müller cells (MIO-M1) were transfected in vitro with a Flag-tagged EGFR expression plasmid or an EGFR-targeting siRNA. Western blotting and coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP) were used to assess the role of EGFR in mediating the interaction between SAV1 and Herc4 and its degradation. In vivo, mice with STZ-induced diabetes received erlotinib (an EGFR inhibitor) intraperitoneally or an intravitreal anti-EGFR antibody. Retinal fibrosis was evaluated via histopathology and YAP signalling analysis. RESULTS: EGFR inhibited YAP signalling by degrading SAV1 and promoting the interaction between SAV1 and the E3 ligase Herc4. Therefore, EGFR can inhibit the Hippo cascade and promote the nuclear translocation of YAP, thus activating the transcription of downstream Hippo target genes. Pharmacological inhibition of EGFR was found to stimulate the YAP signalling pathway and effectively mitigate retinal fibrosis changes in diabetic mice. Moreover, the intravitreal injection of anti-EGFR antibody markedly inhibited diabetic retinal fibrosis, and initiating this treatment early and administering it multiple times proved to be even more efficacious.

Croton tiglium L., a classical TCM herb, contains bioactive alkaloids with established anti-tumor properties. Although crotonoside-containing formulations exhibit anticancer efficacy in vivo, the molecular mechanisms underlying its effects on NSCLC are not fully understood. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to delineate the molecular mechanism through which crotonoside exerts therapeutic effects against NSCLC, with particular emphasis on EGFR signaling pathway modulation and associated downstream cascades. METHODS: This study used a multidisciplinary technical system to investigate the mechanism of crotonoside on NSCLC. First, the cytotoxicity of crotonoside on tumor cells was determined through in vitro cell experiments, and its impact on the apoptosis and migration of NSCLC cells was evaluated. Then, a subcutaneous xenograft mouse model was established to verify the anti-tumor effect of crotonoside in vivo. Network pharmacology and transcriptome analysis were applied to explore potential molecular targets. Differential gene expression and pathway enrichment were validated through qRT-PCR, Western Blotting, and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Crotonoside significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis of NSCLC cells. Mechanistically, it suppressed EGFR activation and attenuated downstream PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK signaling pathways, resulting in decreased expression of oncogenic mediators. CONCLUSION: Crotonoside exerts potent anti-NSCLC activity associated with modulation of the EGFR signaling pathway.

Whereas genetic mechanisms for such acquired resistance have been identified, the molecular mediators of resistance induction have remained unclear. METHODS: To identify factors that mediate induction of osimertinib resistance, we studied clinical samples from individuals with EGFR-mutant NSCLC as well as cell lines including PC-9 and H1975. Methods adopted included transcriptomics analysis and immunohistochemistry of pretreatment NSCLC specimens, spatial transcriptomics analysis, a cell viability assay, immunofluorescence and quantitative PCR analysis, RNA sequencing, immunoblot analysis, comprehensive proteomics analysis by mass spectrometry, co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays, and a mouse xenograft tumor model. RESULTS: Transcriptomics analysis of pretreatment clinical specimens identified IFITM3 (interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3) as a gene specifically upregulated in patients with a poor response to osimertinib treatment. Immunohistochemistry confirmed that patients with IFITM3-positive tumors experienced a shorter progression-free survival on osimertinib treatment. Spatial transcriptomics and other analyses further revealed that IFITM3 expression in tumor cells was increased in response to cytokines derived from the tumor microenvironment (TME) during osimertinib treatment. IFITM3 was found to promote the development of osimertinib resistance in NSCLC cell lines through interaction with MET and activation of the AKT signaling pathway. Furthermore, combined treatment with a MET inhibitor suppressed the development of osimertinib resistance in a mouse xenograft tumor model.

FUNDC1, a receptor involved in mitophagy, regulates cellular senescence and inflammation. This study investigates whether retinal function decline is linked to mitochondrial imbalance in retinal vessels endothelial cells due to reduced FUNDC1 expression.

Moreover, electron microscopy images showed mitochondrial swelling in endothelial cells of aging retina, accompanied with tight junction disruption and reduced expression of junctional proteins (VE-cadherin, occludin, and ZO-1). Strikingly, endothelial knockout of FUNDC1 exacerbated the age-related decline in retinal blood vessel function and retinal function. Cell senescence induced by D-galactose exhibited significantly decreased FUNDC1, impaired mitophagy, increased reactive oxygen species (ROS), and markedly increased endothelial permeability assessed by transendothelial electrical resistance assay.

Very limited data are currently available regarding the role of SIPA1L3 in human carcinoma.

METHODS: We analyzed the distribution of SIPA1L3 in NSCLC specimens by immunohistochemistry, the relationship between SIPA1L3 expression and patient clinicopathological features, and investigated the effect of SIPA1L3 on cell growth and invasion in vivo and in vitro using small interfering RNA. Western blotting and immunoprecipitation were performed to demonstrate the interaction between SIPA1L3 and tight junction-associated angiomotin (AMOT) and Pals1-associtated tight junction protein. RESULTS: We found that SIPA1L3 was overexpressed in NSCLC clinical tissue samples and was associated with several clinicopathological factors. SIPA1L3 affects the proliferation and invasion of cancer cells both in vivo and in vitro. Using a SIPA1L3 mutant, we found that SIPA1L3 interacts with AMOT through its PDZ domain, which inhibits the binding of AMOT to Pals1-associtated tight junction protein and further decreases AMOT anchoring to tight junctions.

N-glycans are covalently attached to asparagine with the consensus sequence of Asn-X-Ser/Thr by an N-glycosidic bond, GlcNAc b1- Asn. Biosynthesis of N-glycans begins on the cytoplasmic face of the ER membrane with the transferase reaction of UDP-GlcNAc and the lipid-like precursor P-Dol (dolichol phosphate) to generate GlcNAc a1- PP-Dol. After sequential addition of monosaccharides by ALG glycosyltransferases [MD:M00055], the N-glycan precursor is attached by the OST (oligosaccharyltransferase) complex to the polypeptide chain that is being synthesized and translocated through the ER membrane. The protein-bound N-glycan precursor is subsequently trimmed, extended, and modified in the ER and Golgi by a complex series of reactions catalyzed by membrane-bound glycosidases and glycosyltransferases. N-glycans thus synthesized are classified into three types: high-mannose type, complex type, and hybrid type.

Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7), a sensor for single-stranded RNA, plays a crucial role in resistance to viral infections, but its function during T. gondii infection remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the role and regulation of the TLR7/MyD88/IRF7 signaling pathway during T. gondii infection. RNA-seq, qRT-PCR, and Western blot analyses revealed significant downregulation of Tlr7 expression in RAW264.7 cells at 24 h post-infection (hpi). Additionally, treatment with the TLR7 agonist imiquimod suppressed T. gondii proliferation in vitro and prolonged survival in infected mice. Time-course analysis uncovered a biphasic regulation of the TLR7/MyD88/IRF7 pathway: during the early infection phase (8 hpi in vitro or 12 hpi in vivo), these components were rapidly upregulated, along with a significant increase in IFN-β mRNA levels. However, as the infection progressed (12-24 hpi in vitro or 24-96 hpi in vivo), the expression of these pathway components and IFN-β declined. Crucially, siRNA-mediated knockdown of Tlr7 abolished this biphasic regulation and significantly suppressed downstream Irf7 and Ifnb1 expression, establishing TLR7 as essential for pathway activation and IFN-β induction. This biphasic regulation of the pathway by T. gondii in RAW264.7 cells has not been previously reported.

Traditional antiseizure medications primarily modulate neurotransmitter systems or ion channels but do not address the underlying neuroinflammation and metabolic dysfunctions that contribute to epileptogenesis. Trimetazidine (TMZ), a cytoprotective agent, has shown potential in reducing seizures at higher doses, but its bioavailability and therapeutic efficacy can be enhanced through intranasal nanoliposomal delivery. This study investigates the formulation, optimization, and evaluation of TMZ-loaded Liposomal Nanocarriers (NTMZ) for enhanced anticonvulsant, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects. NTMZ was designed and optimized using a Box-Behnken design to evaluate the effects of phospholipid concentration, surfactant percentage, and sonication time on particle size, polydispersity index (PDI), and encapsulation efficiency (EE%). The formulations were characterized by dynamic light scattering, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. In vitro release, ex vivo permeation studies, and antioxidant activity assays were conducted. Pharmacological efficacy was evaluated through pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced kindling and increasing current electroshock seizure (ICES) models in Swiss Albino mice. Biochemical analysis of inflammatory markers (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α), neurotransmitter levels (GABA, glutamate), and neuroinflammatory signaling (NF-κB, HMGB1-TLR4) was also performed. NTMZ displayed a particle size of 241.9 nm, a PDI of 0.465, and an entrapment efficiency of 87%. In vitro release showed an initial burst release of 62% in 8 h, followed by sustained release over 24 h. TEM analysis confirmed uniform spherical morphology, and stability tests indicated robust formulations. In vivo studies revealed that 5 mg NTMZ significantly outperformed standard TMZ in PTZ and ICES models, reducing seizure severity and cognitive deficits. NTMZ also suppressed neuroinflammatory markers (IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, HMGB1, TLR4, and NF-κB), enhanced GABAergic neurotransmission, and lowered glutamate levels.

Nevertheless, this formula's specific active constituents and underlying mechanisms of action remain to be fully elucidated. METHODS: The drug components of YQHX and potential targets for liver fibrosis were identified via the screening of the various databases. Qualitative and quantitative identification of chemical components of drug-containing serum by Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC).Liver fibrosis was induced in mice through the intraperitoneal injection of carbon tetrachloride, followed by oral administration of YQHX. RNA-Seq quantified transcriptomic profiles in liver tissue.The degree of liver fibrosis was assessed via histopathology staining, the transcription and expression of relevant proteins were analyzed. Primary cells were isolated for in vitro experiments to validate the influence of YQHX on the associated signaling pathways. RESULTS: Network pharmacology identified IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α as potential targets for YQHX in treating liver fibrosis.The UPLC detected multiple potential active components. In vivo experiments showed that YQHX reduced serum AST and ALT levels in liver fibrosis-induced mice, decreased liverIL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α levels, and improved liver fibrosis.The results of transcriptomics suggest that YQHX can reduce the expression of \"collagen-activated signaling pathway,\" \"MyD88-dependent toll-like receptor signaling pathway,\" \"fibrinolysis\" and \"toll-like receptor 4 signaling pathway\". Furthermore, YQHX reduced the aggregation of M1 macrophages in the portal area and the deposition of α-SMA. Primary bone marrow-derived cells successfully transformed into M1 macrophages after induction, and YQHX reduced the levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α in the supernatant of M1 macrophage culture and decreased the activation of primary hepatic stellate cells indirectly co-cultured with the supernatant. Interestingly, TLR4 agonists weakened this inhibitory effect. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrated that YQHX could inhibit the expression of the TLR4/TRAF6/MyD88 pathway in M1 macrophages. CONCLUSION: We reveal here the molecular mechanism and signaling pathway of YQHX in treating liver fibrosis by utilizing network pharmacology in conjunction with in vivo and in vitro experiments.

This research aims to investigate the lung and reproductive toxicity associated with respiratory exposure to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), particularly focusing on low doses of PFOS which were even lower than the human internal exposure levels. By intratracheal instillation of low (5 μg/kg), medium (25 μg/kg), and high (625 μg/kg) doses of PFOS, we demonstrated that repeated inhalation of PFOS once a week for four consecutive weeks can directly impaired lung function in mice, inducing pulmonary inflammation and fibrotic damage. Even partial inflammatory injury was observed in the 5 μg/kg group. By inhibiting Toll-like receptors (TLRs) 2 and 4 in BEAS-2B cells and RAW264.7 cells, we revealed the crucial role of TLRs signaling pathway in PFOS-induced lung injury. Quantitative UPLC-MS/MS analysis confirmed systemic distribution of PFOS, with blood concentrations reaching 170.58 ng/mL at 25 μg/kg exposure (12.28 % bioavailability). Crucially, this systemic translocation correlated with disrupted steroidogenesis, as evidenced by significant suppression of sex hormone synthesis in mice. Even at extremely low doses, such toxic effects have been observed and further confirmed in vitro models of Leydig cells and ovarian granulosa cells.

Toll-like receptor 9 signaling defect and developing post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome.", "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS) is a functional gastrointestinal disorder that develops after intestinal infection. A follow-up study after a waterborne outbreak of gastroenteritis indicated involvement of specific genetic variants including toll-like receptor (TLR)9, although its pathophysiological role remains unclear. METHODS: To investigate the role of TLR9 in PI-IBS, <i>Citrobacter rodentium</i> was administered to wild-type (WT), and TLR2, 4, and 9 knockout (KO) mice. Six weeks after infection, visceral sensitivity was evaluated using barostat-based colorectal distention. Additional assessments include histological inflammation, intestinal permeability, gut microbiota, and colonic gene expression. RESULTS: Only TLR9 KO mice developed significant visceral hyperalgesia despite findings indicating mild mucosal inflammation in the acute colitis phase and lack of persistent low-grade inflammation with hyperpermeability in the recovered phase. Microbiota analysis and fecal microbiota transfer demonstrated partial involvement of gut dysbiosis in PI-IBS development. Additionally, microarray, PCR, and immunohistochemistry findings showed that the expression levels of the bradykinin B1 and B2 receptors (BDKRB1 and BDKRB2) in colonic epithelium were significantly higher in infected TLR9 KO mice as compared to WT mice. Furthermore, administration of BDKRB1 antagonist R715 and BDKRB2 antagonist HOE 140 significantly suppressed visceral hyperalgesia. CONCLUSION: TLR9 deficiency leads to bradykinin receptor upregulation in the colonic epithelium following infectious colitis, contributing to the development of PI-IBS.

DNGR-1 (CLEC9A), a receptor expressed by type 1 cDCs (cDC1s) and implicated in immune responses to viruses and cancer, recognises F-actin exposed on dead cell remnants and promotes cross-presentation of associated antigens. Here, we show that recruitment of phosphatase SHIP1, a process governed by a single amino acid residue adjacent to the signalling motif of the receptor, partly explains how DNGR-1 fails to trigger cDC1 activation in vitro.

METHODS: Here, we evaluated CIN's antifungal activity using MIC determination, spot assays, and time-growth curves. Cell wall disruption (β-glucan and chitin exposure) was assessed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), and flow cytometry. RESULTS: Transcriptomic and functional enrichment analyses revealed that CIN compromises cell wall integrity by altering 123 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), particularly those governing hyphal development, cell wall biosynthesis, and biofilm formation. Specifically, CIN downregulated genes associated with β-glucan exposure, mannosylation, and chitin synthesis, and upregulated components of the Cek1/MAPK pathway. CIN-enhanced macrophage phagocytosis significantly increased fungal clearance and reduced fungal escape, as shown by flow cytometry, propidium iodide staining, and lactate dehydrogenase release assays.

Although its underlying cause has yet to be fully elucidated, accumulating evidence suggests that neuroinflammation contributes substantially to disease development. Treatment strategies targeting neuroinflammation could improve PD outcomes. Monocyte-derived tolerogenic dendritic cells (tolDCs) modulate immune responses and induce regulatory T cells (Tregs) during various inflammatory diseases. However, the mechanisms underlying tolDC-mediated immunoregulation in PD remain unclear. METHODS: We investigated the immune modulatory role of tolDCs by analyzing gene expression patterns and identified that the C-type lectin domain family 5 member A (Clec5a) was highly induced in tolDCs. To assess its function, we generated Clec5a-knockdown tolDCs and measured cytokine production, including interleukin (IL)-10 and IL-6, forkhead box protein P3 (Foxp3)<sup>+</sup> Treg induction, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) signaling activity. Furthermore, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of Clec5a-expressing dendritic cells (DCs) in a 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mouse model. Dopaminergic neuron survival, α-synuclein (α-syn) accumulation, neuroinflammatory markers, and locomotor behavior were analyzed following DC administration. RESULTS: Clec5a-knockdown tolDCs exhibited reduced immunomodulatory function and IL-10 levels but enhanced IL-6 levels. In addition, these cells induced fewer Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Tregs and showed significantly enhanced NF-κB signaling activity. In the MPTP-induced PD model, administration of Clec5a-expressing DCs ameliorated dopaminergic neuron loss and α-syn accumulation. Furthermore, Clec5a-expressing DCs reduced the number of CD45<sup>high</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD86<sup>+</sup> macrophages in the brain, reduced brain inflammatory cytokine expression, and improved locomotor activity. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that Clec5a plays a critical role in the immunomodulatory function of tolDCs.

The primary cilium is an important center for transduction of the Hedgehog signal in vertebrates. In Hh's absence, the Ptch receptor localizes to the cilium, where it inhibits Smo activation. Gli proteins are phosphorylated by PKA, CKI and GSK3B and partially degraded into truncated Gli repressor form (GliR) that suppresses Hh target gene transcription in the nucleus. In Hh's presence, Ptch disappears from the cilium, and activated Smo contributes to the translocation of the protein complex Gli, Sufu, Kif7 to ciliary tip, where Gli dissociates from the negative regulator Sufu.

Previous studies of epithelial folding have revealed diverse mechanisms driven by epithelium-intrinsic or -extrinsic forces.

Here, we leverage tracheal-esophageal separation (TES), a critical and highly conserved morphogenetic event during tetrapod embryogenesis, as a model system for interrogating epithelial tube splitting. We identify an evolutionarily conserved, compressive force exerted by the mesenchyme surrounding the epithelium, as being necessary to drive epithelial constriction and splitting. The compressive force is mediated by localized convergent flow of mesenchymal cells towards the epithelium. Sonic hedgehog (SHH) secreted by the epithelium functions as an attractive cue for mesenchymal cells.

In the adult hippocampus, primary cilia mediate the effects of sonic hedgehog (Shh) and other signals on neurogenesis and hippocampal function, and loss of cilia leads to cognitive and behavioral deficits. The secreted peptide noggin is a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist and plays a critical role in regulating adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN) and hippocampus-dependent behavior. Here, we show that noggin is expressed by mature granule cell neurons, that it is apically targeted and localized intracellularly near the pocket region of primary cilia, and that cilia regulate noggin release through Shh and somatostatin (SST) pathways. Further, granule cell activation modulates noggin dynamics both in vitro and in vivo. Together, these findings demonstrate synergy between Shh and noggin and the positive regulatory action of neuronal activity on regulating BMP antagonism within the neurogenic niche. Thus, the primary cilium is not only an organelle that transduces signals to neurons but also one that mediates extracellular signaling. Significance statement: Primary cilia are organelles that protrude from the surface of most vertebrate cell types. Defects in primary ciliary structure and function are associated with human disease. Primary cilia are generally viewed as exclusively sensory organelles that respond to environmental signals to regulate both cell development and adult cell function.

While ACR-induced reproductive and developmental toxicity has been reported, the protective role of melatonin (MTN) via modulation of the SHH/GLI3 signaling pathway remains unclear. Pregnant Balb/c mice were divided into three groups (n = 6/group): control (distilled water), ACR (50 mg/kg/d), and ACR (50 mg/kg/d) + MTN (10 mg/kg/d), treated orally from gestational day (GD) 3.5 to GD 13.5. Placentas and embryos were collected for analysis. Oxidative stress (MDA levels), VEGF expression, and SHH/GLI3 pathway activity were assessed using immunohistochemistry and qRT-PCR. ACR exposure induced significant embryotoxicity, manifested as a 34% reduction in fetal weight (1.60 ± 0.09 g vs. 1.88 ± 0.14 g in controls, p < 0.001) and a 46.2% reduction in fetal crown-rump length (0.7 ± 0.08 cm vs. 1.1 ± 0.1 cm, p <  0.001). MTN co-treatment significantly ameliorated these growth restrictions. IHC analysis revealed that ACR significantly reduced SHH protein expression in the embryonic intestine and liver (p < 0.01), while it increased GLI3 protein levels (p < 0.01). MTN effectively normalized the expression of both proteins. At the molecular level, ACR downregulated SHH expression (p <  0.001) and upregulated GLI3 (p <  0.01), which were reversed by MTN. ACR exposure significantly increased oxidative stress (105% increase in placental MDA, p <  0.001) and reduced placental VEGF expression by 69.3% (p <  0.0001), both of which were significantly mitigated by MTN co-treatment.

Therefore, identifying specific pathways crucial for LSC maintenance is necessary.

Inhibition of SMO through genetic knockdown or with a potent, selective SMO inhibitor, Glasdegib, reduces the survival of cells from nonresponder patients.

In the human heart the beta-1-AR is the pre- dominate receptor. Acute sympathetic stimulation of cardiac beta-1-ARs induces positive inotropic and chronotropic effects, the most effective mechanism to acutely increase output of the heart, by coupling to Gs, formation of cAMP by adenylyl cyclase (AC), and PKA- dependent phosphorylation of various target proteins (e.g., ryanodine receptor [RyR]; phospholamban [PLB], troponin I [TnI], and the L-type Ca2+ channel [LTCC]).

Our previous study demonstrated that C-type NP (CNP) reduces arrhythmia after ischaemia-reperfusion injury (I/R) via the cGMP-dependent phosphodiesterase 2 (PDE2) in healthy mice. However, the clinical use of CNP is challenging due to its short plasma half-life. To address this, we investigated whether the more stable CNP analogue vosoritide (VO) reduces arrhythmia at cellular and organ levels in mice with STZ-induced type 1 diabetes (50 µg/g, i.p. for 5 days). After 5 weeks, STZ treatment led to elevated blood glucose and HbA1c levels, impaired cardiac function, and an increased incidence of arrhythmia after I/R in ex vivo perfused hearts. Cardiac PDE2 expression was similarly increased in diabetic mice and diabetic patients with dilated cardiomyopathy. Notably, cGMP-mediated PDE2 activation via VO clearly reduced arrhythmia generation after I/R in ex vivo perfused hearts from diabetic mice (Cohen's d = 2.3). In cardiomyocytes, VO significantly decreased pro-arrhythmic signals upon β-adrenergic stress, such as spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> waves and sparks (Cohen's d = 1.0) or L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> current amplitudes (Cohen's d = 1.6). Specific PDE2 inhibition with BAY 60-7550 or genetic cardiomyocyte-specific PDE2 deletion prevented the anti-arrhythmic VO effects.

Moreover, pressure overload and AT1R overexpression evoked cardiac failure phenotypes in Rac1cKI mice not observed in controls. Mechanistically, Rac1cKI hearts and cardiomyocytes genetically resistant to Rac1 S-palmitoylation had a profound increase in protein kinase A (PKA) substrate phosphorylation in response to acute β-adrenergic stimulation, as did Rac1cKI hearts subjected to chronic AngII treatment, AT1R overexpression, or pressure overload that correlates with more advanced heart failure phenotypes. This was not associated with increased PKA enzymatic activity, suggesting potential deficits in phosphatase activity at PKA-regulated phospho-sites. Taken together, this study suggests Rac1 S-palmitoylation dampens adrenergic drive and PKA-dependent modulation of the phospho-proteome in response to cardiovascular stress, revealing essential functions for S-acylated Rac1 in cardiac adaptation.", "authors": "Teuber JP; Scissors RE; Subramani A; Madamanchi N; Brody MJ", "fulltext_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12581661/", "keywords": "Adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes[MeSH Terms] AND mouse[MeSH Terms]", "llm_relevance_assessment": {"relevance_score": 9, "relevance_level": "High", "species_check": "The pathway is in Mus musculus (mouse), and the study uses a mouse model (Rac1cKI mice), making the species alignment valid.", "evidence_summary": ["This was not associated with increased PKA enzymatic activity, suggesting potential deficits in phosphatase activity at PKA-regulated phospho-sites.", "Taken together, this study suggests Rac1 S-palmitoylation dampens adrenergic drive and PKA-dependent modulation of the phospho-proteome in response to cardiovascular stress."], "reasoning": "The article directly investigates the role of Rac1 S-palmitoylation in modulating adrenergic signaling and PKA activity in cardiomyocytes, which are central to the KEGG pathway 'Adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes'.

We applied this method to analyze infarct border zone transcriptomes from wild-type (WT) and cardiomyocyte-specific α1A-adrenergic receptor knockout (cmAKO) mice subjected to MI via left coronary artery ligation or sham surgery. Our analysis revealed exaggerated cardiomyocyte loss and fibroblast gain in cmAKO mice post-MI compared to WT, implicating α1A-ARs in maintaining cellular homeostasis. We then demonstrate the confounding effect of composition changes though simulations: a modest 10% change in the major cell type's abundance caused over 20% of transcripts to appear as differentially expressed genes (DEGs) when composition was ignored. Applying our correction method refined the interpretation of MI-induced transcriptomic changes, attributing many apparent DEGs, particularly those related to metabolism and inflammation, to shifts in cell abundance rather than direct transcriptional regulation. Importantly, the correction also unveiled previously masked biological processes associated with the cmAKO-specific response to MI, including pathways related to cell adhesion, cell cycle regulation, and stress response, highlighting potential intrinsic mechanisms of α1A-AR cardioprotection.

Pathogenic variants can lead to arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (PKP2-ACM). In patients with PKP2-ACM, exercise and catecholamine surges negatively impact arrhythmia incidence and severity. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to characterize remodeling of the sympathetic input and adrenergic response in hearts of PKP2-deficient mice (PKP2cKO) subjected to endurance exercise. METHODS: We used expansion microscopy and structured illumination to characterize the abundance of beta 1-adrenergic receptors (β1-ARs) in the sarcolemma in PKP2cKO-myocytes, sedentary or trained, and Cre-negative controls. We prevented endogenous catecholamine import by short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of its transporter [organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3)] and characterized differential effects of isoproterenol (membrane permeable) vs norepinephrine (non-membrane permeable) on Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient dynamics. Separately, we evaluated the distribution of sympathetic terminals in PKP2cKO-trained hearts vs controls. RESULTS: Exercise led to \"increased\" abundance of sarcolemma β1-ARs in control, and \"decreased\" abundance in PKP2cKO-myocytes. OCT3 knockdown drastically reduced the response of trained PKP2cKO-myocytes to norepinephrine but not isoproterenol, indicating preserved response to native catecholamines by intracellular (dyad-associated) receptors in the setting of a reduced sarcolemma pool. In tissue, we observed reduced abundance of sympathetic terminals and heterogeneous distribution across the myocardium. CONCLUSION: Endurance exercise in PKP2-deficient myocytes leads to a reduced pool of functional β1-ARs in the sarcolemma and yet availability of intracellular receptors, which can activate selected (and heterogeneous) routes of intracellular signaling cascades. We speculate that remodeling of nerve terminals affects sympathetic input distribution and hence, regional modulation of excitability and conduction.

Locoregional administration has emerged as a promising strategy for CAR-T therapy against solid tumours, yet its potential for HCC treatment has not been thoroughly explored. METHODS: In this study, we constructed anti-GPC3 CAR-T cells and examined their therapeutic efficacy through locoregional and systemic administration using multiple HCC xenograft mouse models. RESULTS: Comparison of CAR-T cell injections via portal vein and tail vein in mice with orthotopic HepG2 tumours demonstrated significantly enhanced tumour growth inhibition with locoregional CAR-T therapy. Consistently, tumour infiltration of CAR-T cells was significantly enhanced by portal vein injection and correlated with increased cytotoxicity, enhanced chemotaxis and reduced exhaustion of the tumour-infiltrating CAR-T cells compared to the tail vein injection group. Treatment with escalating CAR-T cell dosages resulted in further improved functionality of CAR-T cells and treatment efficacy, alongside improved liver function. Furthermore, portal vein injection exhibited superior tumour inhibition compared to tail vein injection in a metastatic model concurrently bearing orthotopic and extrahepatic tumour lesions.

Clarification of the molecular basis underlying metastasis and recurrence is essential for advancing therapeutic development. The present study examines the contribution of hyaluronan-mediated motility receptor (HMMR) to HCC progression and its clinical implications. METHODS: Eighty paired HCC tumor and adjacent non-tumor tissues were obtained from patients who underwent radical resection. HMMR expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses were employed to determine the association of HMMR expression with overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). Functional assays were performed in Huh7 and Hep3B cells with HMMR knockdown or overexpression, including CCK-8 assays for proliferation, Transwell assays for migration and invasion, and Western blotting/qPCR for assessing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers (E-cadherin, N-cadherin, vimentin) and Wnt/β-catenin signaling components (GSK-3β, β-catenin, cyclin D1, c-myc). A subcutaneous xenograft model in nude mice was established to evaluate the effect of HMMR on tumor growth in vivo. Gene set variation analysis (GSVA) and molecular docking were applied to investigate HMMR-related pathways and potential protein-protein interactions. RESULTS: HMMR expression was markedly elevated in HCC tissues compared with adjacent tissues (p < 0.001) at both mRNA and protein levels. Patients with high HMMR expression exhibited reduced median OS (27.8 vs. 32.3 months, p = 0.012) and RFS (9.6 vs. 12.6 months, p = 0.017). In vitro experiments demonstrated that HMMR silencing suppressed Huh7/Hep3B cell proliferation, migration (p < 0.01), and invasion (p < 0.001), while increasing E-cadherin and GSK-3β expression and reducing N-cadherin, vimentin, β-catenin, cyclin D1, and c-myc. Conversely, HMMR overexpression produced opposite effects. In xenograft models, tumors with HMMR knockdown displayed slower growth. GSVA indicated a positive correlation of HMMR expression with EMT and Wnt/β-catenin signaling, and molecular docking confirmed the binding capacity of HMMR to GSK-3β and β-catenin. Mechanistic analysis showed that HMMR suppressed GSK-3β phosphorylation activity, limiting β-catenin ubiquitination and degradation, thereby activating Wnt/β-catenin signaling and driving EMT. CONCLUSIONS: HMMR stabilizes β-catenin by suppressing GSK-3β phosphorylation activity, which reduces β-catenin ubiquitination and degradation.

The gene product contains a central armadillo-repeat containing domain through which it binds the cytoplasmic tail of classical cadherins; meanwhile, it also binds alpha-catenin, which further links the cadherin complex to the actin cytoskeleton either directly or indirectly. Beta-catenin is therefore necessary for the adhesive function of classical cadherins. Another key function of this protein is to mediate the canonical Wnt signaling pathway and regulate gene transcription. Without Wnt signal, cytoplasmic beta-catenin that is not associated with the cadherin complex is quickly phosphorylated at the N-terminal Ser/Thr residues by the so called degradation complex containing axin, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), casein kinase I, and GSK3B, then ubiquitylated by beta-TrCP, and degraded by the proteasome. However, in the presence of Wnt signal, the degradation complex is disrupted and the stabilized cytoplasmic beta-catenin translocates into the nucleus, where it binds various transcription factors and, together with these factors, regulates the transcription of many downstream genes.

Despite advances in supportive care, targeted therapies remain limited. Given the critical role of cAMP signaling in immune regulation and cellular homeostasis, this study explored the therapeutic potential of dipyridamole, a phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor, mitigating SA-AKI. METHODS: Transcriptomic profiling of kidneys from LPS-induced SA-AKI and control mice was performed to identify dysregulated pathways. The effects of dipyridamole on renal pathology and function were evaluated using biochemical assays, PAS staining, TUNEL staining, electron microscopy, and immunohistochemistry. Mechanistic studies included ELISA, qPCR, western blotting, molecular docking, and PDE12 knockdown in TCMK-1 cells with siRNA transfection. RESULTS: Transcriptomic analysis revealed widespread dysfunction of inflammatory and metabolic pathways in SA-AKI kidneys, with upregulation of NF-κB/TLR signaling and suppression of cAMP-related pathways. Among PDE isoforms, PDE12 was most significantly upregulated, and molecular docking demonstrated strong binding of dipyridamole to PDE12. Dipyridamole treatment restored cAMP levels, enhanced CREB phosphorylation, suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α and IL-6), and attenuated necroptosis via inhibition of RIPK3/MLKL signaling. Importantly, siRNA-mediated PDE12 knockdown reproduced these protective effects, confirming PDE12 as a pathogenic mediator of LPS-induced tubular injury. These molecular and cellular changes translated into significant improvements in renal function and histological integrity.

Loss of caspase-8 reduces disease severity and viral load in mice, and this occurs independently of its apoptotic function. Instead, reduction in SARS-CoV-2 pathology is linked to decreased IL-1β levels and inflammation. Loss of pyroptosis and necroptosis mediators in gene-targeted animals provides no additional benefits in mitigating disease outcomes beyond that conferred by loss of caspase-8. Spatial transcriptomic and proteomic analyses of caspase-8-deficient mice confirm that improved outcomes are due to reduced pro-inflammatory responses, rather than changes in cell death signalling. Elevated expression of caspase-8 and cFLIP in infected lungs, alongside caspase-8-mediated cleavage of N4BP1, a suppressor of NF-kB signalling, indicates a role of this signalling axis in pathological inflammation.

Keratinocytes, as key structural components, play a critical role in immune regulation and contribute to disease progression through interactions with various immune cells. Receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) is well-known for its role in necroptosis, acting alongside RIPK1 and mixed-lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL). While studies have shown that inhibitors of necroptosis could alleviate psoriasis-like skin inflammation, direct genetic evidence of RIPK3 is lacking. Furthermore, recent studies have highlighted RIPK3's independent biological functions beyond necroptosis, yet its pathological role in inflammatory skin disease remains poorly understood. This study aimed to elucidate the pathological role of RIPK3 in the progression of skin inflammation, particularly in keratinocytes. We demonstrated that RIPK3 expression was significantly upregulated in psoriasis patients and mice with imiquimod (IMQ)-induced skin inflammation. Importantly, keratinocyte-specific knockout of RIPK3 using gene-editing tools significantly alleviated IMQ-induced skin inflammation in mice. Interestingly, the absence of RIPK3 not only inhibited necroptosis and associated inflammatory responses but also significantly reduced interleukin-36α (IL-36α) expression in keratinocytes. IL-36α, known to drive skin inflammation, promote immune cell recruitment, and disrupt the epidermal barrier, is a critical mediator of inflammatory skin disease pathogenesis. Further investigation using MLKL-knockout mice and keratinocytes revealed that RIPK3 regulates the IL-36α/NF-κB signaling axis through an MLKL-independent mechanism. Collectively, our findings uncover a dual pathogenic role for RIPK3 in skin inflammation: promoting inflammation through both canonical necroptosis and a distinct, non-necroptotic pathway that drives IL-36α activation.

The binding of growth factors to their receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) or G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) stimulates class Ia and Ib PI3K isoforms, respectively. PI3K catalyzes the production of phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PIP3) at the cell membrane. PIP3 in turn serves as a second messenger that helps to activate Akt. Once active, Akt can control key cellular processes by phosphorylating substrates involved in apoptosis, protein synthesis, metabolism, and cell cycle.", "genes": ["100039786"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "41351405", "title": "Integration of Meta-Analysis and Network Pharmacology to Investigate the Pharmacological Mechanisms of Quercetin on Hepatocellular Carcinoma.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is as the most frequently observed histological subtype among primary liver malignancies. While quercetin (QT) shows potential antitumor activity, its preclinical anti-HCC effects and safety (especially in animals) remain unclear. Most existing studies use single methods (e.g., individual animal or <i>in vitro</i> assays), which compromises the reliability of the conclusions. This study's novelty lies in its use of a combined approach-integrating meta-analysis to quantify efficacy and network pharmacology to explore mechanisms, with experimental validation-to address this research gap. This work explores QT's preclinical anti-HCC effects and adverse effects using this integrated approach. METHODS: We collected literature on the treatment of HCC with QT from January 2000 to August 2024. Nine articles meeting the requirements were included in the current study. Subsequent to this, a meta-analysis was conducted, with further validation via network pharmacology approaches and experimental assays. RESULTS: A meta-analysis found that QT significantly inhibited HCC growth (reduced tumor volume/weight) and reduced mortality in tumor-bearing mice, with no significant effect on body weight. Network pharmacology identified protein kinase B alpha (AKT1) and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway as potential therapeutic targets. Finally, the aforementioned conclusions were further verified through experimental validation. CONCLUSION: Preclinically, QT effectively inhibited HCC growth and reduced mortality in tumor-bearing mice without affecting body weight, likely via the PI3K/AKT pathway (targeting AKT1). Our study results furnish preliminary evidence for QT as a promising candidate for HCC adjuvant treatment, supporting its further evaluation in clinical trials.

Pathway.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Apoptosis coincides with the differentiation of skeletal myoblasts, and numerous studies have shown that the apoptotic activity is required for myogenic differentiation. Although the role of apoptosis in skeletal muscle differentiation has been well documented, its mechanism is largely unknown. METHODS: Apoptotic extracellular vesicles (apoVs) were extracted from differentiated C2C12 cells or STS-treated undifferentiated C2C12 myoblasts. C2C12 myoblasts, 8-week-old male mice or 15-month-old male mice were used as in vitro and in vivo models, respectively. These models were treated with C2C12-derived apoVs to explore the biological function and mechanism of apoVs in myogenic differentiation, skeletal muscle development and aging. RESULTS: Proteomic analysis revealed that inhibition of apoptotic activity by Z-VAD-FMK (ZVAD) affected extracellular components. Using immunofluorescence staining, western blotting and transmission electron microscopy analysis, our results demonstrated the generation of apoVs during myogenic differentiation. C2C12-derived apoVs exhibited a typical double-membrane spherical structure, phosphatidylserine exposure and were highly positive for the general apoV markers cleaved caspase 3 (CASP3), Alix and TSG101. Inhibition of apoptotic activity significantly reduced (p = 0.0029) the protein level of myosin heavy chain (1.05 in the Con group vs. 0.38 in the ZVAD group) accompanied by a marked decrease (p < 0.0001) in apoV production (5.91e+10 ± 8.93e+09 in the Con group vs. 1.77e+10 ± 1.36e+09 in the ZVAD group). Proteomic analysis of apoVs suggested that C2C12-derived apoVs contain multiple pro-differentiation proteins, including insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (Igf1r). ApoVs could be taken up by recipient cells and subsequently rescued the impaired C2C12 differentiation induced by ZVAD (p < 0.0001) and promoted the normal myogenic differentiation process (p = 0.0081) by carrying Igf1r and promoting PI3K/AKT/mTOR activation. Knockdown of Igf1r or inhibition of PI3K activation diminished the positive role of apoVs. In addition, apoV treatment promoted skeletal muscle development in 8-week-old male mice (n = 6, Cohen's d = 1.993, power = 0.874) and relieved age-related muscle loss (n = 6, Cohen's d = 3.97, power = 0.999). CONCLUSIONS: In summary, this study demonstrates the generation of apoVs during myogenic differentiation. The apoVs derived from skeletal muscle cells promote skeletal muscle cell differentiation and delay age-related muscle loss.

The gene product contains a central armadillo-repeat containing domain through which it binds the cytoplasmic tail of classical cadherins; meanwhile, it also binds alpha-catenin, which further links the cadherin complex to the actin cytoskeleton either directly or indirectly. Beta-catenin is therefore necessary for the adhesive function of classical cadherins. Another key function of this protein is to mediate the canonical Wnt signaling pathway and regulate gene transcription. Without Wnt signal, cytoplasmic beta-catenin that is not associated with the cadherin complex is quickly phosphorylated at the N-terminal Ser/Thr residues by the so called degradation complex containing axin, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), casein kinase I, and GSK3B, then ubiquitylated by beta-TrCP, and degraded by the proteasome. However, in the presence of Wnt signal, the degradation complex is disrupted and the stabilized cytoplasmic beta-catenin translocates into the nucleus, where it binds various transcription factors and, together with these factors, regulates the transcription of many downstream genes.

factor 1 receptor-mediated RTK signaling in prostatic epithelial cells.", "abstract": "Benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) is a prevalent condition characterized by nonmalignant proliferation of epithelial and stromal components in the prostate, frequently resulting in lower urinary tract symptoms in aging men. While receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling has been implicated in both benign proliferative disorders and malignant tumors, its role in BPH remains insufficiently defined. In this study, transcriptomic analyses of bulk and single-cell RNA sequencing data revealed consistent activation of RTK signaling in prostatic epithelial cells from BPH tissues. Pharmacological inhibition of this pathway using sunitinib suppressed epithelial proliferation in BPH cell lines, organoid models, and an androgen-induced BPH mouse model. Through target screening, colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R) was identified as a central mediator within the RTK signaling cascade. Functional experiments demonstrated that CSF1R promotes epithelial proliferation through activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Mechanistic studies further showed that fibroblasts, which are expanded in BPH tissues, secrete CSF1 and IL34, both ligands of CSF1R, thereby enhancing downstream signaling and stimulating epithelial growth. Neutralization of these ligands or silencing of CSF1R reversed fibroblast-induced epithelial proliferation and clonogenicity. Clinical observations in patients treated with sunitinib confirmed a significant reduction in prostate volume and improvement in BPH-related urinary symptoms.

PURPOSE: This study elucidated the therapeutic potential of Sanshen San (SSS), a traditional Chinese herbal formula encompassing Polygala Radix, Pini Radix in Poria, and Acori Tatarinowii Rhizoma, on cognitive function and AD pathology. METHODS: We implemented both acute Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-injected mice and 5xFAD transgenic mouse models. The therapeutic efficacy of SSS was assessed through behavioral paradigms including Y-maze, Novel Object Recognition, and Morris Water Maze. Molecular mechanisms were delineated utilizing RNA sequencing, metabolomics analysis, immunofluorescence staining, Golgi-Cox staining, transmission electron microscopy, and Western blotting. RESULTS: Chemical analysis unveiled 10 principal bioactive compounds in SSS. The formula substantially ameliorated cognitive performance in both Aβ<sub>1-42</sub>-injected and 5xFAD mouse models, attenuated Aβ plaque burden, and augmented microglial phagocytosis. SSS safeguarded synaptic integrity, enhanced mitochondrial function, and facilitated autophagy. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses demonstrated that SSS predominantly operates by reinstating synaptic transmission and neurotransmitter function, particularly in the dopaminergic system.

{"id": "mmu05410", "name": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy - Mus musculus (house mouse)", "description": "Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a primary myocardial disorder with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance that is characterized by hypertrophy of the left ventricles with histological features of myocyte hypertrophy, myfibrillar disarray, and interstitial fibrosis. HCM is one of the most common inherited cardiac disorders, with a prevalence in young adults of 1 in 500. Hundreds of mutations in the genes that encode protein constituents of the sarcomere have been identified in HCM. These mutations increase the Ca2+ sensitivity of cardiac myofilaments. Increased myofilament Ca2+ sensitivity is expected to increase the ATP utilization by actomyosin at submaximal Ca2+ concentrations, which might cause an imbalance in energy supply and demand in the heart under severe stress. The inefficient use of ATP suggests that an inability to maintain normal ATP levels could be the central abnormality. This theory might be supported by the discovery of the role of a mutant PRKAG2 gene in HCM, which in active form acts as a central sensing mechanism protecting cells from depletion of ATP supplies. The increase in the myfilament Ca2+ sensitivity well account for the diastolic dysfunction of model animals as well as human patients of HCM. It has been widely proposed that left ventricular hypertrophy is not a primary manifestation but develops as compensatory response to sarcomere dysfunction.", "genes": ["104099"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "40936293", "title": "Myosin-binding protein C slows cardiac myofibril relaxation kinetics.", "abstract": "Mutations in cardiac myosin binding protein C (cMyBP-C) are a leading cause of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Patients with HCM often have reduced cMyBP-C expression, reduced protein phosphorylation, and diastolic dysfunction. Relaxation of a single myofibril in response to a sudden drop in activator calcium is biphasic, consisting of a slow isometric phase (k<sub>REL</sub>,<sub>slow</sub>) followed by a fast exponential phase (k<sub>REL</sub>,<sub>fast</sub>), considered to reflect cross-bridge-dependent and -independent processes, respectively. Here, we determined the effects of cMyBP-C on myofibril activation and relaxation kinetics by deleting the C0-C7 fragment of cMyBP-C and replacing it using our 'cut-and-paste' method. Results show that acute loss of C0-C7 desensitized myofilaments to Ca<sup>2+</sup> and sped both phases of relaxation. Ligation of recombinant wild-type C0-C7 returned relaxation rates back to baseline, whereas ligation of phosphorylated cMyBP-C left the fast relaxation phase accelerated and increased the rate of activation in response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> (k<sub>ACT</sub>). Mavacamten (Mava), an inhibitor of myosin, accelerated both phases of relaxation independently of the presence or absence of cMyBP-C. Finally, we found that a point mutation in the M-domain of cMyBP-C (L348P) slowed both phases of relaxation. Taken together, we report that cMyBP-C slows both phases of relaxation, suggesting that it affects relaxation via cross-bridge-dependent and -independent mechanisms. KEY POINTS: Mutations in MYBPC3, the gene encoding cardiac myosin-binding protein C, (cMyBP-C) occur in ∼20%-25% of patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. The majority of these mutations lead to reduced cMyBP-C protein expression in sarcomeres (haploinsufficiency). Here we investigated effects of acute loss of cMyBP-C on relaxation kinetics in mouse cardiac myofibrils using our 'cut and paste' approach. Results showed that cMyBP-C slows both phases of myofibril relaxation. Phosphorylation of cMyBP-C accelerated the fast phase of relaxation, whereas a point mutation (L348P) that increases the affinity of cMyBP-C for actin, significantly slowed both phases of relaxation. Mavacamten, a myosin inhibitor, accelerated both phases of relaxation independently of cMyBP-C.

"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The pathogenesis and progression of heart failure (HF) are governed by complex, interconnected biological pathways, with dysregulated immune responses and maladaptive cardiac remodeling playing central roles. Although specific inflammatory mediators have been implicated in modulating critical features of cardiac remodeling-such as cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and extracellular matrix fibrosis-the precise molecular mechanisms driving these processes remain incompletely characterized. METHODS: Integrated bioinformatics analysis of HF and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) transcriptomic datasets identified pathologically relevant candidate genes. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed from these candidates using the STRING database, followed by module analysis. Serum S100 calcium-binding protein A9 (S100A9) protein expression in HF patients was quantified by Western blotting under reducing conditions. The functional relevance of prioritized genes was subsequently validated through: (i) in vitro cyclic mechanical stretch in primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, and (ii) in vivo pressure overload modeling via transverse aortic constriction (TAC) in mice. RESULTS: Bioinformatics analysis of HF and HCM datasets revealed a significant association between immune function and cardiac remodeling. Using CytoNCA, we identified core genes, among which the top 25 included multiple inflammatory pathway-related factors, such as S100A9 and Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2). Notably, S100A9 levels were significantly elevated in the serum of HF patients and in mechanically stretched cardiomyocytes. This increase correlated with upregulated expression of hypertrophy-related markers, including atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). Furthermore, mechanical stretch-induced S100A9 upregulation markedly enhanced TLR2 expression in cardiomyocytes.

METHODS: Single-nucleus RNA sequencing was performed to analyze gene expression in patients with HCM (n=12), categorized into the following groups: normal, reduced, and heart failure. We validated our findings in additional cohorts of patients undergoing septal resection or heart transplantation. Cardiac-specific <i>Pdk4</i> knockout mice were crossed with <i>Mybpc3</i> knockout mice, and PDK4 inhibition was also tested in <i>Mybpc3</i> knockout mice. Cardiac metabolism was assessed via metabolic flux and Seahorse analysis in vivo and in vitro. RESULTS: Single-nucleus RNA sequencing identified distinct cardiomyocyte clusters, with cardiomyocyte cluster 4 (<i>PDK4</i>+ cardiomyocytes) significantly associated with impaired cardiac function and highly expressed in the cardiac tissue of patients with HCM heart failure.

However, it has remained unclear whether DNA synthesis pathways play a direct role in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. We previously discovered in a mouse model of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy that there was increased DNA synthesis, which led to cardiomyocyte endoreplication and replication stress-induced DNA damage. We hypothesized that targeting cardiomyocyte endoreplication pathways could reduce pathological myocardial hypertrophy. METHODS: We utilized murine models of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy secondary to mutations in cardiac Mybpc3 (myosin-binding protein C3)<sup>-/-</sup> or Myh6 (myosin heavy chain 6)<sup>R404Q</sup> and transverse aortic constriction as a model of pressure overload cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. We manipulated in vivo p21 (cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor 1) protein levels using transgenic mouse models or viral transduction. Cardiomyocyte endoreplication was assessed using flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry of cardiomyocyte nuclei. We also utilized proteomics, proximity ligation assays, and human-induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes. RESULTS: We discovered that p21 protein peaked during the early stages of hypertrophic growth in both murine hypertrophic cardiomyopathy models and a pressure overload hypertrophy model. Using genetic manipulation of p21 expression, we discovered that cardiomyocyte endoreplication and hypertrophic growth were negatively correlated with p21 expression. Mechanistically, we discovered that p21 bound to PCNA (proliferating cell nuclear antigen), which led to a reduction of PCNA binding to POLD1 (DNA polymerase delta 1). Directly targeting PCNA or POLD1 prevented cardiomyocyte DNA synthesis and hypertrophic cardiomyocyte growth. Cardiomyocyte-selective overexpression of p21 using an adeno-associated virus vector reduced long-term pathological left ventricular hypertrophy and improved diastolic function in a preclinical murine model of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Myh6<sup>R404Q</sup>).

It integrates all somatic sensory pathways (excluding olfaction) and transmits information through thalamic relay neurons before projecting to the cerebral cortex via thalamocortical axons (TCAs). Emerging evidence has shown that FGF3, a member of the morphogen family, is an axon guidance molecule that repels TCAs away from the hypothalamus and into the internal capsule so that they subsequently reach different regions of the cortex. However, current studies on FGF-mediated axon guidance predominantly focus on phenomenological observations, with limited exploration of the underlying molecular mechanisms.

Firstly, we used pharmacological inhibitors to identify the signaling cascade(s) responsible for FGF3-triggered direct chemorepulsion of TCAs, in vitro and in vivo. Our results demonstrate that the PC-PLC pathway is required for FGF3 to directly stimulate the asymmetrical repellent growth of developing TCAs.

NeuroD2, a critical transcription factor, plays a crucial role in neuronal development and synaptic maturation. This study investigates the role of NeuroD2 in hippocampal neuron organization, focusing on hilar mossy cells during aging, and employs bioinformatics to identify NeuroD2 targets linked to cellular aging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used 21 adult C57Bl/6 mice, categorized into three age groups: young (2 months), old (12 months), and very old (24 months). Mice were administered BrdU intraperitoneally for three consecutive days, 10 days before euthanasia. The brains were harvested and analyzed using immunofluorescence, Western blotting, and quantitative real-time PCR to evaluate NeuroD2 expression and associated signaling pathways in hippocampal tissue. Additionally, bioinformatics analysis was performed using two open-access datasets (ProteomeXchange Consortium, Dataset identifier: PXD043352; Gene Expression Omnibus, GEO: GSE67539) and to explore potential interactions between NeuroD2 targets and biological aging components. RESULTS: Our results revealed that NeuroD2 expression changed significantly with age and correlated with AKT signaling. Moreover, we identified a potential link between NeuroD2 activity and the AKT pathway, indicating NeuroD2's role in mitigating aging-related stress. Bioinformatics analysis identified 513 down-regulated and 638 up-regulated proteins, with NeuroD2 targets involved in axonal projection showing increased expression in older mice. Contrary to expectations, pathway enrichment analysis highlighted axon guidance molecules rather than oxidative stress markers. CONCLUSION: This study underscores NeuroD2's critical role in preserving hippocampal integrity and reveals molecular mechanisms underlying age-related neuronal changes. Our findings provide insights into the role of NeuroD2 in regulating key pathways during healthy aging, potentially mitigating the impacts of aging.", "authors": "Beker M; Bolat B; Johnson BS; Ercin N; Cakmak RK; Kaya SB; Besli N; Celik U; Beker MC", "fulltext_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12223602/", "keywords": "Axon guidance[MeSH Terms] AND mouse[MeSH Terms]", "llm_relevance_assessment": {"relevance_score": 8, "relevance_level": "High", "species_check": "The pathway is in Mus musculus (mouse), and the study uses C57Bl/6 mice, so the species match directly.", "evidence_summary": ["Bioinformatics analysis identified 513 down-regulated and 638 up-regulated proteins, with NeuroD2 targets involved in axonal projection showing increased expression in older mice.", "Pathway enrichment analysis highlighted axon guidance molecules rather than oxidative stress markers."], "reasoning": "The study directly investigates axon guidance in the context of aging in mice, a key focus of the KEGG pathway mmu04360.

To examine the evolutionary conservation of midline repulsive signaling, here we express Robo family proteins from mouse in neurons of the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. We show that Robo proteins which normally function in canonical Slit-dependent midline repulsion in the mouse (mRobo1 and mRobo2) can also repel Drosophila axons from the midline in the fly embryonic ventral nerve cord, and can partially rescue the ectopic midline crossing defects caused by loss of Drosophila robo1, though less efficiently as Drosophila Robo1 itself. In contrast, mouse Robo3 isoforms (mRobo3.1 and mRobo3.2) which do not normally respond to Slit have no detectable effect on axon guidance when expressed in fly embryos. We further show that the differences in midline repulsive signaling effectiveness between fly and mouse Robos is not due to a simple difference in Slit affinity conferred by the Slit-binding Ig1 domain.

Here, we investigated the functional role of the axon guidance cue SEMA3A in supporting PDAC progression. DESIGN: We integrated bulk and single-cell transcriptomic datasets of human PDAC with in situ hybridisation analyses of patients' tissues to evaluate SEMA3A expression in molecular subtypes of PDAC. Gain and loss of function experiments in PDAC cell lines and organoids were performed to dissect how SEMA3A contributes to define a biologically aggressive phenotype. RESULTS: In PDAC tissues, SEMA3A is expressed by stromal elements and selectively enriched in basal-like/squamous epithelial cells. Accordingly, expression of SEMA3A in PDAC cells is induced by both cell-intrinsic and cell-extrinsic determinants of the basal-like phenotype. <i>In vitro</i>, SEMA3A promotes cell migration as well as anoikis resistance. At the molecular level, these phenotypes are associated with increased focal adhesion kinase signalling through canonical SEMA3A-NRP1 axis. SEMA3A provides mouse PDAC cells with greater metastatic competence and favours intratumoural infiltration of tumour-associated macrophages and reduced density of T cells. Mechanistically, SEMA3A functions as chemoattractant for macrophages and skews their polarisation towards an M2-like phenotype. In SEMA3A<sup>high</sup> tumours, depletion of macrophages results in greater intratumour infiltration by CD8+T cells and better control of the disease from antitumour treatment.

Prior studies demonstrated that SMN deficiency impaired bone development, but the underlying mechanism of abnormal endochondral ossification remains obscure. Here, we showed SMN is involved in hypertrophic chondrocytes differentiation through regulating RNA splicing and protein degradation via analyzing single cell RNA-sequencing data of hypertrophic chondrocytes. Of note, SMN loss induced dwarfism and delayed endochondral ossification in Smn1 depletion-severe spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) mouse model and Smn1 chondrocyte conditional knockdown mouse. Histological analysis revealed that SMN deficiency expanded the zone of hypertrophic chondrocytes in the growth plates, but delayed turnover from hypertrophic to ossification zone. Widespread changes in endochondral ossification related gene expression and alternative splicing profiles were identified via RNA sequencing of growth plate cartilages from SMA mice on postnatal day 4. Importantly, Mass spectrometry-based proteomics analysis elucidated Y-box-binding protein 1 (YBX1) as a vital SMN-binding factor, was decreased in SMA mice. YBX1 knockdown reproduced the aberrant gene expression and splicing changes observed in SMA growth plate cartilages. Comparing the binding proteins of SMN and YBX1 revealed TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), which promoted ubiquitination degradation of YBX1.

Therefore, developing novel therapeutic drugs and treatment methods to improve the prognosis of patients with NSCLC is critical. PURPOSE: This study examined the effect of Melittin (MEL) on NSCLC metastasis and explored the underlying regulatory mechanisms. METHODS: The effects of different doses of MEL on NSCLC cells was examined using Transwell and wound healing assays. RT-qPCR and western blotting were performed to assess the mRNA and protein expression of proteasome 20S subunit alpha 7 (PSMA7) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition-related genes such as E-cadherin and N-cadherin. A PSMA7 overexpressing lentiviral vector was constructed and transfected into HCC1833 and A549 cells to examine the inhibitory effect of MEL on NSCLC malignant progression. Proteomics analyses were performed to identify differentially expressed proteins in NSCLC cells following MEL treatment. The potential involvement of the ubiquitin degradation pathway was examined using cycloheximide and MG132. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays were performed to detect interactions between PSMA7, ubiquitin-specific peptidase (USP)-10, and ring finger protein (RNF)-20. An in vivo lung metastasis model was used to evaluate the effects of MEL on NSCLC metastasis. RESULTS: MEL treatment suppressed the malignant migration of NSCLC cells, as shown in Transwell and wound healing assays. MEL treatment also inhibited NSCLC lung metastasis in vivo. Proteomics analysis showed that MEL inhibited PSMA7 expression. Existing studies have shown that PSMA7 affects EMT process mainly by regulating the protein stability of key EMT factors. MEL downregulated EMT key factors, N-cadherin and upregulated E-cadherin, and it activated the ubiquitin degradation pathway, as shown by cycloheximide and MG132 treatments. Co-IP experiments showed that PSMA7 interacts with USP10 and RNF20. Molecular docking validated the interaction of MEL with USP10, confirming the involvement of the ubiquitin pathway in the effects of MEL on promoting the degradation of PSMA7. PSMA7 overexpression significantly reversed the inhibitory effect of MEL on NSCLC cell metastasis in vitro.

The gene product contains a central armadillo-repeat containing domain through which it binds the cytoplasmic tail of classical cadherins; meanwhile, it also binds alpha-catenin, which further links the cadherin complex to the actin cytoskeleton either directly or indirectly. Beta-catenin is therefore necessary for the adhesive function of classical cadherins. Another key function of this protein is to mediate the canonical Wnt signaling pathway and regulate gene transcription. Without Wnt signal, cytoplasmic beta-catenin that is not associated with the cadherin complex is quickly phosphorylated at the N-terminal Ser/Thr residues by the so called degradation complex containing axin, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), casein kinase I, and GSK3B, then ubiquitylated by beta-TrCP, and degraded by the proteasome. However, in the presence of Wnt signal, the degradation complex is disrupted and the stabilized cytoplasmic beta-catenin translocates into the nucleus, where it binds various transcription factors and, together with these factors, regulates the transcription of many downstream genes.

Neoprzewaquinone A (NEO), a phenanthrenequinone derivative of Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge with anti-tumor effect, inhibits the migration and proliferation of breast cancer and human megakaryocytic leukemia cells. However, its function and the mechanism of action in HCC remain unclear. METHODS: To evaluate the anti-HCC effectiveness of NEO, we employed patient-derived organoids, HepG2 cell-derived xenograft model, and hepatoma cell lines. Techniques such as molecular docking, drug affinity responsive target stability (DARTS), cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA), apoptosis anlysis, in vivo ubiquitination, and Western blot analysis were used to investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms. RESULTS: In the current study, the anti-HCC effectiveness of NEO was validated using human HCC organoids and HepG2 cell-derived xenograft model. Meanwhile, NEO treatment reduced the viability, proliferation, migration, invasion of hepatoma cells, and increased the apoptosis ratio of hepatoma cells. Next, we found that NEO directly engaged with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with molecular docking, DARTS, and CETSA. NEO decreased the level of EGFR through promoting ubiquitin-related degradation. NEO treatment suppressed the levels of phosphorylated AKT (p-AKT) and phosphorylated Bad (p-Bad), and NEO treatment increased Cleaved Caspase-3 protein expression, as shown by KEGG pathway analysis, which also indicated that NEO modulates the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway.

The symptoms are choreiform, involuntary movements, personality changes and dementia. HD is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the IT15 gene, which results in a long stretch of polyglutamine (polyQ) close to the amino-terminus of the HD protein huntingtin (Htt). Mutant Htt (mHtt) has effects both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. Full-length huntingtin is cleaved by proteases in the cytoplasm, leading to the formation of cytoplasmic and neuritic aggregates. mHtt also alters vesicular transport and recycling, causes cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+  overload, triggers endoplasmic reticulum stress through proteasomal dysfunction, and impairs autophagy function, increasing neuronal death susceptibility.

Furthermore, by downregulating NLRP3 in Q74-transfected bEnd.3 cells or in hHTT130 mouse brain vascular endothelial cells, BBB disruption and endothelial cell pyroptosis were alleviated, the number of surviving neurons was significantly increased.

Clinical positron emission tomography studies suggest that phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) declines earlier than dopamine D1 and D2 receptors in HD, indicating that it might serve as a key molecular marker in understanding disease mechanisms. In movement disorders, mutations in the genes encoding PDE10A and G-protein α subunit (Gα<sub>olf</sub>), both critical cAMP regulators in striatal spiny projection neurons, have been linked to chorea and dystonia. These observations highlight the potential importance of striatal cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling in these disorders, but how such dysfunction could come is unknown. Here, we suggest that a key to understanding signaling dysfunction might be to evaluate these messenger systems in light of the circuit-level compartmental organization of the caudoputamen, in which there is particular vulnerability of the striosome compartment in HD. We developed machine learning algorithms to define with high precision and reproducibility the borders of striosomes in the brains of Q175 knock-in (Q175KI) HD mice from 3-12 months of age.

These cells stimulate strong cell-mediated immune responses, particularly against intracellular pathogens.

Conditioned medium derived from stem cells of human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED-CM) exhibits considerable immunomodulatory and regenerative effects. We evaluated the efficacy of SHED-CM in an AD-like mouse model and explored the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Mice with ovalbumin (OVA)-specific allergic dermatitis (OSAD) were intravenously treated with SHED-CM, conditioned medium derived from fibroblast, or Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium, followed by antigen restimulation to induce AD-like dermatitis. Disease severity was assessed macroscopically and histologically. T cell phenotypes were analyzed using immunohistochemical staining, RT-qPCR, and flow cytometry. Total serum and OVA-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels were measured using ELISA. Naïve splenic CD4⁺ T cells were activated using CD3/CD28 beads in SHED-CM to evaluate their direct effects on T cell differentiation through flow cytometry. Highly expressed proteins in SHED-CM were identified using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, and neutralizing antibodies were used to elucidate the therapeutic mechanisms. RESULTS: The treatment with SHED-CM significantly ameliorated AD-like symptoms, reduced epidermal hyperplasia, and restored filaggrin expression. SHED-CM created an anti-inflammatory microenvironment in OSAD skin and draining lymph nodes by promoting Treg differentiation and inhibiting Th2 and Th17 populations. SHED-CM markedly suppressed B cell maturation, antigen-specific IgE production, and mast cell activation. Furthermore, we found that SHED-CM directly promoted Treg differentiation from naïve CD4⁺ T cells stimulated by CD3/CD28, which was mediated, in part, through TGFβ contained in SHED-CM.

In this study, we investigated whether L-NAA modifies AD-like symptoms elicited by ongoing DNFB exposure in NC/Nga mice. Topical administration of L-NAA markedly attenuated the development of AD-like cutaneous lesions triggered by DNFB. L-NAA treatment further suppressed DNFB-induced infiltration of eosinophils and mast cells and prevented the increase of serum IgE resulting from DNFB application.

Despite advancements in synthetic drugs like enalapril, evidence for plant-derived candidates that slow kidney fibrosis remains limited, underscoring the need for rigorous preclinical evaluation. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluates the antifibrotic efficacy of Morus alba Linn. leaf extract (MLE) and its primary compound, chlorogenic acid (CGA), in a mouse model of renal fibrosis induced by unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-five male Balb/c mice were assigned to five groups: sham operation (SO), UUO control, UUO with enalapril treatment, UUO with MLE, and UUO with CGA. Treatments were administered orally for 14 days, followed by assessments of fibrosis through histological analysis, immunohistochemistry, gene expression profiling, and molecular docking. RESULTS: Results indicated significant reductions in basement membrane thickening (from 31.19% in UUO to 21.87% with MLE), collagen deposition (from 6.85% to 2.7%), and decreased expression of key fibrotic markers such as TGF-β1 (from 26.21% to 11.91% with MLE and 5.92% with CGA), FGF-2, Collagen-1, Smad3, alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), and β-catenin. Molecular docking analysis suggested that CGA formed plausible interactions with transforming growth factor beta receptor 1 (TGFβR1) (-9.5 kcal/mol) and fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) (-8.3 kcal/mol), indicating its potential antifibrotic properties.

The gene product contains a central armadillo-repeat containing domain through which it binds the cytoplasmic tail of classical cadherins; meanwhile, it also binds alpha-catenin, which further links the cadherin complex to the actin cytoskeleton either directly or indirectly. Beta-catenin is therefore necessary for the adhesive function of classical cadherins. Another key function of this protein is to mediate the canonical Wnt signaling pathway and regulate gene transcription. Without Wnt signal, cytoplasmic beta-catenin that is not associated with the cadherin complex is quickly phosphorylated at the N-terminal Ser/Thr residues by the so called degradation complex containing axin, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), casein kinase I, and GSK3B, then ubiquitylated by beta-TrCP, and degraded by the proteasome. However, in the presence of Wnt signal, the degradation complex is disrupted and the stabilized cytoplasmic beta-catenin translocates into the nucleus, where it binds various transcription factors and, together with these factors, regulates the transcription of many downstream genes.

Quiescent hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) differentiate into activated HSCs or myofibroblasts, which drives liver fibrosis and contribute to the progressive loss of hepatic function. MASH with progressive fibrosis lacks effective therapies due to incomplete understanding of HSCs regulation.

HT is characterized by the presence of goitre, thyroid autoantibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and thyroglobulin (Tg) in serum and varying degrees of thyroid dysfunction. During HT, self-reactive CD4+ T lymphocytes (Th) recruit B cells and CD8+ T cells (CTL) into the thyroid. Disease progression leads to the death of thyroid cells and hypothyroidism. Both autoantibodies and thyroid-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) have been proposed to be responsible for autoimmune thyrocyte depletion. In GD, the TSH-R is the most important autoantigen. Antibodies directed against it mimic the effects of the hormone on thyroid cells, TSH, stimulating autonomous production of thyroxine and triiodothyronine and causing hyperthyroidism. The presence of TSH-R-blocking antibodies that bind the TSH receptor in a similar fashion to the antibodies in patients with Grave's disease but that block rather than activate the receptor explains some cases of atrophic hypothyroidism.", "genes": ["100504404"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "41010493", "title": "Immunomodulatory Effects of <i>Lactobacillus brevis</i> NES-428 in a Hyperthyroidism Mouse Model: Potential Applications for Graves' Disease.", "abstract": "<b>Background:</b> Safe, microbiome-based interventions for autoimmune hyperthyroidism are lacking.

Here we evaluated its immunomodulatory and anti-thyroid activity in cellular and murine models. <b>Methods:</b> Jurkat T cells (5 × 10<sup>6</sup>) were incubated with heat-killed NES-428 for 24 h and subsequently stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate/ionomycin (50 ng mL<sup>-1</sup>/1 µg mL<sup>-1</sup>) for 6 h; cytokine transcripts were quantified by qRT-PCR. Hyperthyroidism was induced in female BALB/c mice by three intramuscular injections of adenovirus-encoding human TSH receptor (Ad-TSHR).

In animal experiments, female C57BL/6 mice were divided into Con, HT, HT+T (Trp supplemented), and HT+I (Trp metabolism inhibitor IDO1/TDO-IN-4 treated) groups. After inducing autoimmune thyroiditis, various tests were conducted, including ELISA for inflammation factors, HE staining for thyroid pathology, flow cytometry for T cell subsets, RNA-seq for gene expression, Western Blotting for PI3K-Akt pathway proteins, and CIBERSORT for immune cell analysis. RESULTS: HT patients had significantly lower serum Trp levels. The HT group showed thyroid damage and increased inflammation factors. Trp supplementation alleviated thyroid damage and reduced inflammation factors, while the inhibitor worsened them. Trp also regulated T cell subsets and immune cell environment. RNA-seq and Western Blotting indicated Trp's impact on immune response and PI3K-Akt pathway. CONCLUSION: Trp metabolism abnormality is associated with HT.

This domain is regulated by cohesin unloader and overlaps with chromatin regions reeled through the break-anchored loop, suggesting that loop extrusion regulates the homology search.

Homologous recombination (HR) plays a pivotal role in maintaining genome stability through its DNA repair and replication fork escort functions. Therefore, HR is classified as a tumour suppressor pathway. Consistently, many HR genes are mutated in cancer, especially in hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. However, although RAD51 controls the central steps of HR, no RAD51 mutations are associated with cancer predisposition, constituting the \"RAD51 paradox\". One of the potential explanations for the \"RAD51 paradox\" is that mutations affecting mediator/accessory genes (such as BRCA1 or BRCA2) in cancer result in the absence of RAD51 on damaged DNA, leaving access to alternative exclusively mutagenic repair processes, such as single-strand annealing (SSA) or alternative end-joining (A-EJ), which can rescue some cell viability but also increase genetic instability. This raises the question of whether cancer predisposition actually results from HR deficiency itself or from alternative, nonconservative repair pathways. One study assessing this question in a mouse model revealed that decreasing RAD51 HR activity without stimulating SSA or A-EJ in vivo not only does not favour tumorigenesis but rather protects against it. These data suggest that RAD51-controlled HR is not a tumour suppressor but rather favours tumour progression. Cancer cells are highly proliferative, actively replicating their genomes, and are therefore subjected to high replication stress; pathways enabling them to cope with this massive replication stress, such as HR, should help them survive and proliferate, contrary to the belief dogma that HR acts as a tumour suppressor pathway.

SUMMARY ANSWER: This study identifies novel pathogenic variants in zinc finger SWIM domain-containing protein 7 (SWS1/ZSWIM7) and its partner, SWSAP1, which impair interhomolog homologous recombination (IH-HR) and lead to isolated POI. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Knockout mice models of the SWS1-complex (also known as the SWS1-SWSAP1-SPIDR complex or Shu complex) are infertile due to meiotic arrest. Variants of both SWS1/ZSWIM7 and SPIDR are described in POI, but so far, no SWSAP1 variants have been described in female infertility. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Screening for SWS1-complex variants was performed using exome or genome sequencing data from women with POI as ongoing patient care. In silico modelling, IH-HR assays, and western-blot analysis were performed to test the impact of novel variants identified in genes of the SWS1-complex (SWSAP1 and SWS1/ZSWIM7) on homologous recombination, protein expression, and protein interactions. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Five unrelated patients from France were enrolled based on their exome or genome sequencing result as part of ongoing patient care. All the patients were diagnosed with POI and met the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) diagnostic criteria for POI. Functional validation was performed using mouse embryonic stem cells to study the impact of two novel variants found in two patients. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: We report five different pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in five patients. We report the previously described c.231_232del and c.176C>T variants in SWS1/ZSWIM7, as well as two novel variants, c.22del and c.151C>T. Additionally, we report a homozygous frameshift deletion in SWSAP1 (c.353del). All the patients display a similar phenotype of severe isolated POI, associated with primary or early secondary amenorrhea and signs of puberty delay. In silico modelling and IH-HR assays of both SWS1/ZSWIM7 c.176C>T and SWSAP1 c.353del indicated a partial decrease or absence of IH-HR activity in Sws1-/- or Swsap1-/- cells, respectively, and destabilization of the SWSAP1 truncation mutant. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Identification of other patients carrying SWSAP1 variants is needed to evaluate in-depth phenotype to genotype correlations. Future studies should evaluate the role of other genes in the SWS1-complex and explore the potential for therapeutic interventions targeting homologous recombination. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: These findings provide direct clinical and functional evidence that all three members of the SWS1-complex are implicated in female fertility and recapitulate the observed mouse phenotypes. IH-HR assays provide a relevant functional approach to validate novel variants in homologous recombination genes for POI patients, given the importance of IH-HR for meiotic progression.

The key shear stress-induced transcription factors that govern the expression of these genes are Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-like 2 (Nrf2). On the other hand, disturbed flow with associated reciprocating, low shear stress generally upregulates the EC genes and proteins that promote oxidative and inflammatory states in the artery wall, resulting in atherogenesis.

Neutrophil extracellular trap (NET)-mediated inflammation plays an important role in atherosclerosis. However, little is known about the relationship between low shear stress (LSS) and NET generation, as well as the underlying mechanism. METHODS: We induced LSS by partial ligation of the left carotid artery in high-fat diet-fed male ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice. To further validate the direct relationship between LSS and NET formation invitro, differentiated human promyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells and bone marrow-derived neutrophils were suspended in fluid flow under normal or low shear stress using a parallel-plate flow chamber system. RESULTS: Four weeks after surgery, ligated carotid arteries had more lipid deposition, larger plaque area, and increased NET formation than unligated arteries. Inhibition of NETosis could significantly reduce plaque formation in ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Invitro, LSS could promote NET generation directly through downregulation of Piezo1, a mechanosensitive ion channel. Downregulation of Piezol could activate neutrophils and promote NETosis in static conditions. Conversely, Yoda1-evoked activation of Piezo1 attenuated LSS-induced NETosis. Mechanistically, downregulation of Piezo1 resulted in decreased Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and increased histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2), which increased reactive oxygen species levels and led to NETosis. LSS-induced NET generation also promoted apoptosis and adherence of endothelial cells. CONCLUSION: LSS directly promotes NETosis through the Piezo1-HDAC2 axis in atherosclerosis progression. This study uncovers the essential role of Piezo1-mediated mechanical signaling in NET generation and plaque formation, which provides a promising therapeutic strategy for atherosclerosis.", "authors": "Zhu Y; Wang T; Yang Y; Wang Z; Chen X; Wang L; Niu R; Sun Z; Zhang C; Luo Y; Hu Y; Gu W", "fulltext_url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2024.117473", "keywords": "Fluid shear stress and atherosclerosis[MeSH Terms] AND mouse[MeSH Terms]", "llm_relevance_assessment": {"relevance_score": 9, "relevance_level": "High", "species_check": "The pathway is in Mus musculus (mouse), and the study uses ApoE-/- mice and human HL-60 cells, making it a valid model for the pathway.", "evidence_summary": "Low shear stress could promote NET generation directly through downregulation of Piezo1, a mechanosensitive ion channel.

For decades, endothelial cell (EC) responses to fluid-generated wall shear stress have been the central focus for atherogenesis. However, circulating blood is not a cell-free fluid, it contains mechanosensitive red blood cells (RBCs) that are also subjected to altered hemodynamics and release a large amount of ATP, but their impact on atherosclerosis has been overlooked. The focus of this study is the role of shear stress (SS)-induced RBC-released ATP in atherosclerosis. Hypercholesterolemic mouse models with and without RBC-Pannexin 1 deletion were used for the study. Results showed that SS-induced release of ATP from RBCs was at µM concentrations, three-orders of magnitude higher than that from other cell types. Suppression of RBC-released ATP via deletion of Pannexin 1, a mechanosensitive ATP-permeable channel, reduced high-fat diet-induced aortic plaque burden by 40%-60%. Importantly, the location and the extent of aortic atherosclerotic lesions spatially matched with the ATP deposition profile at aortic wall predicted by a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model. Furthermore, hypercholesterolemia increases EC susceptibility to ATP with potentiated increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, an initial signaling for aortic EC barrier dysfunction, and an essential cause for lipid accumulation and inflammatory cell infiltration. The computational prediction also provides a physics-based explanation for RBC-released ATP-induced sex disparities in atherosclerosis.

These novel findings provide a more comprehensive view of how altered hemodynamics and systemic risk factors synergistically contribute to atherosclerosis.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> This study reveals that, in addition to fluid-derived wall shear stress, the disturbed blood flow-induced release of ATP from mechanosensitive red blood cells (RBCs), the major cellular components of blood, along with hypercholesterolemia-induced increases in endothelial cell susceptibility to ATP contribute significantly to the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis.

endothelial cells (ECs) trigger atherogenesis, especially at arterial regions experiencing disturbed blood flow. UCP2 (Uncoupling protein 2), a key mitochondrial antioxidant protein, improves endothelium-dependent relaxation in obese mice. However, whether UCP2 can be regulated by shear flow is unknown, and the role of endothelial UCP2 in regulating inflammation and atherosclerosis remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the mechanoregulation of UCP2 expression in ECs and the effect of UCP2 on endothelial inflammation and atherogenesis. METHODS: In vitro shear stress simulation system was used to investigate the regulation of UCP2 expression by shear flow. EC-specific Ucp2 knockout mice were used to investigate the role of UCP2 in flow-associated atherosclerosis. RESULTS: Shear stress experiments showed that KLF2 (Krüppel-like factor 2) mediates fluid shear stress-dependent regulation of UCP2 expression in human aortic and human umbilical vein ECs. Unidirectional shear stress, statins, and resveratrol upregulate whereas oscillatory shear stress and proinflammatory stimuli inhibit UCP2 expression through altered KLF2 expression. KLF2 directly binds to UCP2 promoter to upregulate its transcription in human umbilical vein ECs. UCP2 knockdown induced expression of genes involved in proinflammatory and profibrotic signaling, resulting in a proatherogenic endothelial phenotype. EC-specific <i>Ucp2</i> deletion promotes atherogenesis and collagen production. Additionally, we found endothelial <i>Ucp2</i> deficiency aggravates whereas adeno-associated virus-mediated EC-<i>Ucp2</i> overexpression inhibits carotid atherosclerotic plaque formation in disturbed flow-enhanced atherosclerosis mouse model. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed FoxO1 (forkhead box protein O1) as the major proinflammatory transcriptional regulator activated by UCP2 knockdown, and FoxO1 inhibition reduced vascular inflammation and disturbed flow-enhanced atherosclerosis. We showed further that UCP2 level is critical for phosphorylation of AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase), which is required for UCP2-induced inhibition of FoxO1. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, our studies uncover that UCP2 is novel mechanosensitive gene under the control of fluid shear stress and KLF2 in ECs.

These predilection sites (side branches, curved segments, and bifurcations) have often been associated with disturbed shear stress profiles. However, in addition to shear stress, endothelial cells also experience artery wall strain that could contribute to atherosclerosis progression. Herein, we describe a method to accurately obtain these shear stress and strain profiles. We developed a fluid-structure interaction (FSI) framework for modelling arteries within a commercially available package (Abaqus, version 6.14) that included known prestresses (circumferential, axial and pressure associated). In addition, we co-registered 3D histology to a micro-CT-derived 3D reconstruction of an atherosclerotic carotid artery from a cholesterol-fed ApoE<sup>-/-</sup> mouse to include the spatial distribution of lipids within a subject-specific model. The FSI model also incorporated a nonlinear hyperelastic material model with regionally-varying properties that distinguished between healthy vessel wall and plaque. FSI predicted a lower shear stress than CFD (~-12%), but further decreases in plaque regions with softer properties (~-24%) were dependent on the approach used to implement the prestresses in the artery wall. When implemented with our new hybrid approach (zero prestresses in regions of lipid deposition), there was significant heterogeneity in endothelial shear stress in the atherosclerotic artery due to variations in stiffness and, in turn, wall strain. In conclusion, when obtaining endothelial shear stress and strain in diseased arteries, a careful consideration of prestresses is necessary.

Emerging evidence indicates that yes-associated protein (YAP) and transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ), which are both effectors of the Hippo pathway, sense different blood flow patterns and regulate atherosclerotic lesions. We previously found that methotrexate (MTX) reduces in-stent neoatherosclerosis, decreases the plaque burden, and has an effect on local fluid shear stress. Here, we investigated the atheroprotective effect of MTX under DF and the mechanisms underlying these properties. METHODS: Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were subjected to biomechanical stretch using a parallel-plate flow system and treated with or without MTX at therapeutically relevant concentrations. Additionally, an extravascular device was used to induce DF in the left common carotid artery of C57BL/6 mice, followed by treatment with MTX or 0.9% saline. The artery was then assessed histopathologically after 4 weeks on a Western diet. RESULTS: We observed that MTX significantly inhibited DF-induced endothelial YAP/TAZ activation. Furthermore, it markedly decreased pro-inflammatory factor secretion and monocyte adhesion in HUVECs but had no effect on apoptosis. Mechanistically, AMPKa1 depletion attenuated these effects of MTX. Accordingly, MTX decreased DF-induced plaque formation, which was accompanied by YAP/TAZ downregulation in vivo. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, we conclude that MTX exerts protective effects via the AMP-dependent kinase (AMPK)-YAP/TAZ pathway. These results provide a basis for the prevention and treatment of atherosclerosis via the inhibition of YAP/TAZ.", "authors": "Liu D; Lv H; Liu Q; Sun Y; Hou S; Zhang L; Yang M; Han B; Wang G; Wang X; Du W; Nie H; Zhang R; Huang X; Hou J; Yu B", "fulltext_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6857284/", "keywords": "Fluid shear stress and atherosclerosis[MeSH Terms] AND mouse[MeSH Terms]", "llm_relevance_assessment": {"relevance_score": 8, "relevance_level": "High", "species_check": "The pathway is in Mus musculus (mouse), and the study uses C57BL/6 mice as a model for atherosclerosis, making it a valid model organism.", "evidence_summary": "We observed that MTX significantly inhibited DF-induced endothelial YAP/TAZ activation.

"BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is caused by chronic inflammation, however it is yet unknown how interleukin-36 cytokines contribute to coronary artery disease (CAD) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), including how different isoforms affect myocardial remodeling and their possible therapeutic applications. METHODS: Using a publicly available dataset (GSE97320), we conducted transcriptome analysis to investigate IL-36 expression patterns and associated pathways. To find immunological networks and signaling interactors, functional enrichment and protein-protein interaction studies were performed. RT-qPCR was used to evaluate a validation cohort of 300 patients, and results were further validated in a DCM rat model. The diagnostic performance of interleukin-36 isoforms was assessed using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: There was a consistent upregulation of interleukin-36 in both DCM and CAD, with IL36G exhibiting the most marked increase (4.9-fold in DCM; p < 0.001). Compared to CAD, expression levels in DCM were noticeably greater. ROC analysis showed good diagnostic accuracy, especially for DCM's IL36A (AUC = 0.98). Interleukin-36 isoform overexpression was verified at the cardiac tissue level in the mouse DCM model. The IL-36R-NF-κB axis is the primary mechanism by which intwerleukin-36 signaling is involved in pro-fibrotic and inflammatory responses, according to pathway and interaction analyses.

Canonical βAR signaling originates at the plasma membrane, but functional βARs have been localized to intracellular membranes such as the endosome, sarcoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, and nuclear envelope. The functional significance of these intracellular receptors remains unclear, including whether they regulate cellular processes distinct from those regulated by plasma membrane receptors and whether they can be independently targeted for therapeutic benefit. METHODS: Live cell imaging of rat and human cardiomyocytes expressing novel compartment-specific modulators of βAR activity and fluorescent biosensors was used to study the compartment-specific βAR regulation of second messengers and to target enzyme activity. Compartmentalized signaling was compared with myocyte gene expression and hypertrophy. Adeno-associated virus gene delivery conferring gain and loss of perinuclear βAR activity was studied in wild-type mice and a mouse model of familial dilated cardiomyopathy. RESULTS: We demonstrate here that intracellular β<sub>1</sub>ARs present on Golgi membrane facing the outer nuclear membrane regulate a perinuclear cAMP compartment containing the A-kinase anchoring protein 6β signalosome, conferring selective regulation of perinuclear cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity independently of βARs at the plasma membrane or endosome. The A-kinase anchoring protein 6β compartment is shown to be of nanometer scale and dependent on local restriction of cAMP diffusion. In addition, perinuclear βARs are shown to be sufficient and necessary for activation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent calcineurin-nuclear factor of activated T cells pathway and myocyte hypertrophy in vitro. Accordingly, adeno-associated virus 9-based delivery of an outer nuclear membrane-localized pepducin, which selectively activated perinuclear βARs in vitro, induced dilated cardiomyopathy in wild-type mice. Conversely, in vivo delivery of an outer nuclear membrane-localized nanobody, which selectively inhibited perinuclear βARs in vitro, improved cardiac function and inhibited pathological remodeling in a mouse model of familial dilated cardiomyopathy with established disease. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that β<sub>1</sub>ARs localized to Golgi membranes facing the outer nuclear membrane regulate A-kinase anchoring protein 6β signalosomes required for the induction of pathological cardiac remodeling, defining an intracellular nanocompartment.

The family of endocannabinoids includes at least five derivatives of arachidonic acid; the two best characterized are arachydonoyl ethanolamide (anandamide, AEA) and 2-arachydonoil glycerol (2AG). They are released from postsynaptic neurons upon postsynaptic depolarization and/or receptor activation. The released endocannabinoids then activate the CB1 receptors (CB1R) at presynaptic terminals and suppress the release of inhibitory transmitter GABA (depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition, DSI) or excitatory transmitter glutamate (depolarization-induced suppression of excitation, DSE) by inhibiting Ca2+ channels. Besides the well-known expression of the CB1R in the plasma membrane, this receptor is also present in mitochondrial membranes, where it reduces the mitochondrial respiration and contributes to DSI. Whereas DSI and DSE result in short-term synaptic plasticity, endocannabinoids also mediate long-term synaptic changes (eCB-LTD).

Instead, by developing a workflow for physiological, anatomical, and molecular measurements at the same unitary synapse, we demonstrate that the nanoscale stoichiometric ratio of type 1 cannabinoid receptors (CB<sub>1</sub>Rs) to the release machinery is sufficient to predict synapse-specific release probability. Accordingly, selective decrease of extrasynaptic CB<sub>1</sub>Rs does not affect synaptic transmission, whereas in vivo exposure to the phytocannabinoid Δ<sup>9</sup>-tetrahydrocannabinol disrupts the intrasynaptic nanoscale stoichiometry and reduces synaptic variability.

GnRH Neurons via Suppressing the Retrograde Tonic Endocannabinoid Signaling Pathway in Mice.", "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Hypophysiotropic gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons orchestrate various physiological events that control the onset of puberty. Previous studies showed that insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) induces the secretion of GnRH and accelerates the onset of puberty, suggesting a regulatory role of this hormone upon GnRH neurons. METHODS: To reveal responsiveness of GnRH neurons to IGF-1 and elucidate molecular pathways acting downstream to the IGF-1 receptor (IGF-1R), in vitro electrophysiological experiments were carried out on GnRH-GFP neurons in acute brain slices from prepubertal (23-29 days) and pubertal (50 days) male mice. RESULTS: Administration of IGF-1 (13 nM) significantly increased the firing rate and frequency of spontaneous postsynaptic currents and that of excitatory GABAergic miniature postsynaptic currents (mPSCs). No GABAergic mPSCs were induced by IGF-1 in the presence of the GABAA-R blocker picrotoxin. The increase in the mPSC frequency was prevented by the use of the IGF-1R antagonist, JB1 (1 µM), or the intracellularly applied PI3K blocker (LY294002, 50 µM), showing involvement of IGF-1R and PI3K in the mechanism. Blockade of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1, an element of the tonic retrograde endocannabinoid machinery, by AMG9810 (10 µM) or antagonizing the cannabinoid receptor type-1 by AM251 (1 µM) abolished the effect. DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that IGF-1 arrests the tonic retrograde endocannabinoid pathway in GnRH neurons, and this disinhibition increases the release of GABA from presynaptic terminals that, in turn, activates GnRH neurons leading to the fine-tuning of the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis.", "authors": "Bálint F; Csillag V; Vastagh C; Liposits Z; Farkas I", "fulltext_url": "https://doi.org/10.1159/000514043", "keywords": "Retrograde endocannabinoid signaling[MeSH Terms] AND mouse[MeSH Terms]", "llm_relevance_assessment": {"relevance_score": 9, "relevance_level": "High", "species_check": "The pathway is in Mus musculus (mouse), and the study uses prepubertal and pubertal male mice, ensuring species consistency.", "evidence_summary": ["Blockade of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1, an element of the tonic retrograde endocannabinoid machinery, by AMG9810 (10 µM) or antagonizing the cannabinoid receptor type-1 by AM251 (1 µM) abolished the effect.", "These findings indicate that IGF-1 arrests the tonic retrograde endocannabinoid pathway in GnRH neurons."], "reasoning": "The article directly investigates the retrograde endocannabinoid signaling pathway in the context of GABAergic neurotransmission in GnRH neurons.

In the brain stem, vagal afferent terminals release the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate to neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS).

Here, we investigated the effects of corticosterone (CORT) on glutamate signaling in the NTS using patch-clamp electrophysiology on brain stem slices containing the NTS and central afferent terminals from male C57BL/6 mice. We found that CORT rapidly decreased both action potential-evoked and spontaneous glutamate signaling. The effects of CORT were phenocopied by dexamethasone and blocked by mifepristone, consistent with glucocorticoid receptor (GR)-mediated signaling. While mRNA for GR was present in both the NTS and vagal afferent neurons, selective intracellular quenching of G protein signaling in postsynaptic NTS neurons eliminated the effects of CORT. We then investigated the contribution of retrograde endocannabinoid signaling, which has been reported to transduce nongenomic GR effects.

The most abundant brain endocannabinoid, 2 arachidonoyl glycerol (2-AG), is primarily synthesized by diacylglycerol lipase-α (DGLα), which is activated by poorly understood mechanisms in response to calcium influx following post-synaptic depolarization and/or the activation of G<sub>q</sub> -coupled group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors. However, the impact of other neurotransmitters and their downstream signaling pathways on synaptic 2-AG signaling has not been intensively studied. Here, we found that DGLα activity in membrane fractions from transfected HEK293T cells was significantly increased by in vitro phosphorylation using cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). Moreover, PKA directly phosphorylated DGLα at Ser798 in vitro. Elevation of cAMP levels in HEK293 cells expressing DGLα increased Ser798 phosphorylation, as detected using a phospho-Ser798-specific antibody, and enhanced DGLα activity; this in situ enhancement of DGLα activity was prevented by mutation of Ser798 to Ala. We investigated the impact of PKA on synaptic 2-AG mobilization in mouse striatal slices by manipulating D1-dopamine receptor (D1R) signaling and assessing depolarization-induced suppression of excitation, a DGLα- and 2-AG-dependent form of short-term synaptic depression.

EBV has the unique ability to establish life-long latent infection in primary human B lymphocytes. During latent infection, EBV expresses a small subset of genes, including 6 nuclear antigens (EBNA-1, -2, -3A, -3B, -3C, and -LP), 3 latent membrane proteins (LMP-1, -2A, and -2B), 2 small noncoding RNAs (EBER-1 and 2).

Despite evidence pointing to the role of neuroinflammation and astrocyte-mediated disruptions in brain function, the mechanistic details remain elusive. METHODS: SARS-CoV-2 spike receptor-binding domain (RBD) was microinjected into the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) to mimic cerebral infection, and the depressive-like behaviors, functional connectivity, and neuronal excitability were recorded for a 16-day period. Immunofluorescence, RNA sequencing, and ELISA were used to evaluate astrocytic gap junctions and inflammation. Gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) dysfunction was confirmed by transfer of lucifer yellow (LY), cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), and cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP). We also investigated the role of Cx43 using conditional knockout mice, Gap 27-treated mice, and Cx43-knockdown astrocytes. Astrocytic Cx43 overexpression and celecoxib treatment were tested as a potential therapeutic to rescue Cx43 function. RESULTS: Mice microinjected with RBD into the mPFC exhibited significant depressive-like behaviors, decreased neuronal excitability, and disrupted functional connectivity, accompanied by a marked reduction in astrocytic Cx43 expression and impaired GJIC. Functional assays, including Lucifer Yellow, cAMP, and cGAMP transfer, confirmed compromised gap junction activity, which was further associated with enhanced astrocytic type I interferon responses and cGAS-STING pathway activation. Conditional knockout of Cx43 in astrocytes or pharmacological inhibition of GJIC mimicked the depressive-like phenotypes induced by RBD.

In this study, we employed bulk Poly(A) RNA-Seq technique and found that Cx26 deficiency could cause many genes up- and down-regulated in the cochlea. One of the unexpected findings is significant upregulation of a gap junctional gene GJA3 (Cx46), which normally expresses in the eye rather than the ear. Quantitative PCR and digital droplet PCR further confirmed the promotion of Cx46 expression in the cochlea after Cx26 deficiency. Immunofluorescent staining showed that the promoted Cx46 was expressed at the same location as Cx26 expression in the cochlea and integrated into the same gap junctional plaques. This promotion is Cx26-specific; there was no promotion of Cx46 expression in the cochlea after knockout (KO) of Cx30 (GJB6), which is another predominant connexin co-expressed in the cochlea. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) revealed that Cx26 deficiency but not Cx30 KO upregulated a phototransduction pathway to promote the eye-specific gene Cx46 expression in the cochlea.

As such, understanding the mechanisms of endothelial healing is essential to the development of vascular therapeutics and procedures. Gap junctions formed by connexin 43 (Cx43) are implicated in regulating skin wound healing, but their role in endothelial healing is unknown. Secondary analysis of RNA-seq data from in vivo injured mouse aortas (GEO: GSE115618) identified significant Cx43 upregulation in EC postinjury. We developed a novel in vivo model of EC injury using mouse carotid artery ligation to test the role of Cx43. We identified that EC immediately adjacent to the wound edge upregulate Cx43 protein expression, predominantly at cell-cell junctions. We show significantly delayed EC healing in a mouse model of inducible EC-specific Cx43 deletion [EC-Cx43 knockout (KO)] at 24 h post ligation. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis of 10,829 cells from 18 h injured EC-wild type (WT) and EC-Cx43 KO carotids revealed a Cx43-associated reduction in enrichment of EC pathways associated with migration, proliferation, and ERK/MAPK signaling pathways. Finally, the importance of Cx43 phosphorylation on EC healing was tested in mice with single-point alanine mutations (phospho-null) in known phosphorylation sites that alter Cx43 channel assembly and opening. Mice containing alanine mutations at ERK phosphorylated Cx43 serines (Cx43<sup>S255/262/279/282A</sup>) have reduced healing rates similar to EC-Cx43 KO mice.

Gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC), particularly involving Connexin43 (Cx43), is vital for maintaining central nervous system (CNS) homeostasis, and disruption of GJIC is a well-documented pathogenic mechanism among β-coronaviruses. Specifically, murine β-coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-A59) inoculation in the mouse brain causes acute-stage CNS viral spread and chronic neuroinflammatory demyelination while causing pronounced downregulation of Cx43 at the acute stage, reflecting a critical role in CNS pathology. To pharmacologically target Cx43, 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA) has been widely used, since it enhances the expression of ER-resident thioredoxin family protein (ERp29), a molecular chaperone of Cx43. 4-PBA has been shown to have anti-viral effects against MHV-A59 <i>in vitro</i>; however, the <i>in vivo</i> efficacy of 4-PBA is unknown. This study investigates the effect of 4-PBA administration on the pathology of MHV-A59 infection <i>in vivo</i>. We demonstrate that 4-PBA treatment reduced acute MHV-A59 infectivity and viral spread in the brain while modulating the glial cell response and mounting host immunity. MHV-A59 infection downregulated the expression of ERp29 in the CNS, which was rescued by 4-PBA treatment. Furthermore, treatment with 4-PBA effectively preserved the expression of Cx43 and Cx47 in infected CNS cells, counteracting their infection-induced downregulation. 4-PBA treatment not only limits acute viral replication and spread throughout the brain but also protects against severe chronic virus-induced neuroinflammatory demyelination <i>in vivo</i>. These findings highlight 4-PBA's significant anti-viral potential against murine β-CoV and therapeutic potential in mitigating virus-induced neuroinflammatory demyelination.IMPORTANCEPast outbreaks and the emergence of novel coronaviruses pose a serious global health threat, warranting studies on the disease mechanism of these viruses and the development of new anti-viral strategies. In the current study, we demonstrated the antiviral potential of 4-phenylbutyric acid (4-PBA) against a neurotropic murine β-coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-A59). MHV-A59 inoculation in the brain causes virus infection and disruption of gap junction (GJ) communication by the downregulation of GJ proteins connexin 43 (Cx43) and connexin 47 (Cx47), crucial for maintaining CNS homeostasis. We demonstrate that 4-PBA restricts viral spread and infectivity in the mouse brain and improves the reduced levels of ERp29 and, thus, Cx43 and Cx47 in the infected CNS. Furthermore, 4-PBA mitigated virus-induced chronic neuroinflammatory demyelination, the characteristic feature of multiple sclerosis (MS).

In adipose tissue, it is upregulated during adipose beiging while downregulated by high-fat-diet (HFD) feeding. Adipocyte-specific Gja1 overexpression enhances adipose tissue beiging in response to mild cold stress of room temperature. Moreover, those mice display a surprising decrease in food intake, but the mechanism remains unclear. This study investigates how adipocyte Cx43 influences feeding behavior. METHODS: Mice with adipose tissue-specific Gja1 overexpression (Adipoq-Cx43) were fed with HFD. Food intake, weight gain, substrate utilization, and serum lipolysis were assessed. RNA-seq, proteomics, and cytokine measurements were employed to identify candidate signals. Sensory neurons were manipulated via subcutaneous capsaicin injection or iWAT-targeted optogenetics. Co-culture of adipocytes and sensory neurons in vitro was used to test gap junction communication between these two types of cells. RESULTS: Adipoq-Cx43 mice showed reduced food intake, fat mass, and weight gain on HFD, and shifted substrate utilization toward fatty acids. Although GDF15 was elevated, its neutralization did not reverse the reduced food intake. Instead, systemic ablation of sensory neurons using capsaicin abolished the suppressed food intake. Ooptogenetic activation of sensory neurons in iWAT acutely reduced food intake and improved glucose tolerance after two weeks. In the co-culture of adipocytes and in vitro differentiated sensory neurons, optogenetic stimulation of adipocytes enhanced firing of the adjacent sensory neurons via gap junctions, an effect blocked by the gap junction inhibitor carbenoxolone.

Although the role of apoptosis in skeletal muscle differentiation has been well documented, its mechanism is largely unknown. METHODS: Apoptotic extracellular vesicles (apoVs) were extracted from differentiated C2C12 cells or STS-treated undifferentiated C2C12 myoblasts. C2C12 myoblasts, 8-week-old male mice or 15-month-old male mice were used as in vitro and in vivo models, respectively. These models were treated with C2C12-derived apoVs to explore the biological function and mechanism of apoVs in myogenic differentiation, skeletal muscle development and aging. RESULTS: Proteomic analysis revealed that inhibition of apoptotic activity by Z-VAD-FMK (ZVAD) affected extracellular components. Using immunofluorescence staining, western blotting and transmission electron microscopy analysis, our results demonstrated the generation of apoVs during myogenic differentiation. C2C12-derived apoVs exhibited a typical double-membrane spherical structure, phosphatidylserine exposure and were highly positive for the general apoV markers cleaved caspase 3 (CASP3), Alix and TSG101. Inhibition of apoptotic activity significantly reduced (p = 0.0029) the protein level of myosin heavy chain (1.05 in the Con group vs. 0.38 in the ZVAD group) accompanied by a marked decrease (p < 0.0001) in apoV production (5.91e+10 ± 8.93e+09 in the Con group vs. 1.77e+10 ± 1.36e+09 in the ZVAD group). Proteomic analysis of apoVs suggested that C2C12-derived apoVs contain multiple pro-differentiation proteins, including insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (Igf1r). ApoVs could be taken up by recipient cells and subsequently rescued the impaired C2C12 differentiation induced by ZVAD (p < 0.0001) and promoted the normal myogenic differentiation process (p = 0.0081) by carrying Igf1r and promoting PI3K/AKT/mTOR activation. Knockdown of Igf1r or inhibition of PI3K activation diminished the positive role of apoVs. In addition, apoV treatment promoted skeletal muscle development in 8-week-old male mice (n = 6, Cohen's d = 1.993, power = 0.874) and relieved age-related muscle loss (n = 6, Cohen's d = 3.97, power = 0.999).

The prolactin receptor long-form (PRLR-LF), which has been implicated in depression pathogenesis, activates the downstream Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)/signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) signaling cascade. Immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that nuclear STAT5 physically interacts with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), forming a transcriptional repressor complex that attenuates GR-dependent gene expression. Given the critical role of hippocampal GR in stress responses and depression, we hypothesized that the PRLR-LF-JAK2/STAT5-GR pathway in the hippocampus mediates depression-like behavior in prenatally stressed offspring. We established a prenatal restraint stress model and assessed depression-like behavior using sucrose preference and forced swim tests. To establish causality, we genetically modulated PRLR-LF expression through hippocampal microinjection of AAV-mediated overexpression or knockdown constructs in 21-day-old offspring. The results show that PS significantly upregulated hippocampal PRLR-LF expression and JAK2/STAT5 phosphorylation while downregulating GR expression and nuclear translocation--effects observed exclusively in female offspring. PRLR-LF knockdown in PS-exposed females attenuated depression-like behavior, normalizing JAK2/STAT5 activation and GR dysfunction. Conversely, PRLR-LF overexpression in control females induced depression-like behavior and replicated GR suppression in the hippocampus.

Like all other herpesviruses, KSHV displays two modes of life cycle, latency and lytic replication, which are characterized by the patterns of viral gene expression. Genes expressed in latency (LANA, v-cyclin, v-FLIP, Kaposins A, B and C and viral miRNAs) are mainly thought to facilitate the establishment of life long latency in its host and survival against the host innate, and adaptive immune surveillance mechanisms. Among the viral proteins shown to be expressed during lytic replication are potent signaling molecules such as vGPCR, vIL6, vIRFs, vCCLs, K1 and K15, which have been implicated experimentally in the angiogenic and inflammatory phenotype observed in KS lesions. Several of these latent viral and lytic proteins are known to transform host cells, linking KSHV with the development of severe human malignancies.", "genes": ["100043318"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "40036222", "title": "Repurposing alcohol-abuse drug disulfiram for the treatment of KSHV-infected primary effusion lymphoma by activating antiviral innate immunity.", "abstract": "Cancer remains a leading cause of global mortality, characterized by high treatment costs, and generally poor prognoses.

Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is an aggressive B-cell malignancy linked to Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) infection. In this study, we identified that disulfiram (DSF), an FDA-approved medication for alcohol dependence, acts as a potent inhibitor of KSHV-positive PEL.

Remarkably, DSF effectively impedes KSHV reactivation and virion production in both PEL and endothelial cells. Inhibition of TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1) or interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), essential activators of antiviral innate immunity, reverses DSF's effects on PEL cell survival and KSHV reactivation.

Genetic deletion of STAT3 in B cells of <i>CD19<sup>cre/+</sup>Stat3<sup>f/f</sup></i> mice reduced peak MHV68 latency approximately sevenfold.

To circumvent the systemic immune alterations observed in the B cell-STAT3 knockout mice and more directly evaluate intrinsic roles for STAT3, we generated mixed bone marrow chimeric mice consisting of WT and STAT3 knockout B cells. We discovered a dramatic reduction in latency in STAT3 knockout B cells compared to their WT B cell counterparts in the same lymphoid organ. RNA sequencing of sorted germinal center B cells revealed that MHV68 infection shifts the gene signature toward proliferation and away from type I and type II IFN responses.

STAT3 promoted B cell processes of the germinal center, including IL-21-stimulated downregulation of surface CD23 on B cells infected with MHV68 or EBV.

In solid tumors, the PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitory pathway can be (mis-)used to silence the immune system by increasing the expression of PD-L1 on the tumor cell surface. Up-regulation of PD-L1 is caused by activation of pro-survival pathways MAPK and PI3K/Akt as well as transcriptional factors HIF-1, STAT3 and NF-kappa B. The MAPK and PI3K signalling pathways are activated by gene mutations and growth factors. PD-L1 on tumor cells may then engage the PD-1 receptors resulting in suppression of T-cell mediated immune response. Therapeutic antibodies blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway by targeting PD-L1 or PD-1 are highly effective in rescuing T cell anti-tumor effector functions.", "genes": ["106759"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "41075009", "title": "Enhancing anti-tumor immunity by targeting BATF and the STAT1/PD-L1 pathway in cervical carcinoma.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cervical carcinoma remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in women worldwide, with poor prognosis often linked to immune evasion mechanisms. The Basic Leucine Zipper Activating Transcription Factor (BATF) has emerged as a critical regulator of T-cell functionality, yet its role in cervical cancer progression and immune modulation remains poorly understood. This study investigates the role of BATF in cervical carcinoma, focusing on its effects on tumor progression, immune modulation, and immune checkpoint regulation, to identify BATF as a therapeutic target to enhance anti-tumor immunity. METHODS: BATF expression was analyzed in cervical cancer tissues and cell lines. Functional assays, including cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, were performed following BATF knockdown. In vivo studies assessed tumor growth and metastasis in xenograft models. Immune cell populations, cytokine production, and immune checkpoint expression were analyzed using flow cytometry, quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and immunohistochemistry. Mechanistic studies evaluated BATF regulation of programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) through the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) signaling pathway. Finally, the therapeutic potential of BATF knockdown in combination with PD-L1 blockade was evaluated in vivo. RESULTS: Analysis of patient-derived samples and cell lines revealed that BATF is overexpressed in cervical cancer and correlates with poor prognosis. Functional studies demonstrated that BATF promotes tumor proliferation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), migration, and invasion. In vivo, BATF knockdown significantly suppressed tumor growth and metastasis in xenograft models. Immune profiling revealed that BATF deficiency enhanced antitumor immunity by increasing CD8⁺ and CD4⁺ T-cell infiltration, increasing the production of CD8⁺ cytotoxic molecules such as granzyme B and IFN-γ while reducing tumor-associated macrophages and immune checkpoint expression, including Programmed death 1 (PD-1), T cell immunoglobulin and mucin-domain-containing-3 (TIM-3), and Lymphocyte activation gene-3 (LAG-3.) Mechanistically, BATF regulated PD-L1 expression via the STAT1 signaling pathway, promoting immune evasion. Combination therapy with BATF knockdown and anti-PD-L1 antibodies significantly enhanced anti-tumor immunity and inhibited tumor growth compared to monotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: BATF plays a pivotal role in cervical cancer progression and immune evasion by regulating the STAT1/PD-L1 axis and modulating the tumor immune microenvironment.

However, resistance to ICIs remains a major challenge, and the underlying mechanisms of this resistance are not yet fully understood. This study aimed to investigate the role of S100 calcium-binding protein A9 (S100A9) in mediating resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy. APPROACH AND RESULTS: We conducted RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on tumor samples from anti-PD-1 responders and non-responders in HCC patients. Differential expression analysis identified S100A9 as a potential driver gene of resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy. Subcutaneous tumor models and an orthotopic HCC model established via hydrodynamic transfection were utilized to evaluate the impact of S100A9 on the efficacy of PD-1 therapy. Our findings revealed that S100A9 promotes resistance to anti-PD-1 therapy in HCC. Mechanistically, S100A9 directly interacted with PARP1 and induced its degradation via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. This process increased STAT3 phosphorylation at Tyr705, thereby enhancing PD-L1 transcription. Notably, treatment with the S100A9 inhibitor Tasquinimod significantly improved the efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy in HCC. CONCLUSIONS: Our study reveals that S100A9 facilitates immune evasion in HCC by enhancing PARP1 ubiquitination, STAT3 phosphorylation, and PD-L1 expression.

Metformin has been shown to inhibit cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion while inducing apoptosis and inhibiting the expression of PD-L1. To leverage the synergistic therapeutic effects of TPP-1 and metformin, we designed and constructed a peptide-small molecule drug delivery system using tumor cell membranes. First, nanoscale tumor cell membrane vesicles were prepared via hypotonic ultrafiltration and coupled with the TPP1 peptide through co-incubation to form TPP1-cell membrane complexes. Simultaneously, mesoporous silica nanomaterials were synthesized and loaded with metformin by using the sol-gel method. Finally, the two components were mixed and sonicated to create the final drug delivery system.

Unlike MSI-H gastric cancer, GS and CIN subtypes exhibit immunologically inert microenvironments and demonstrate minimal response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB), necessitating novel strategies to overcome immunotherapy resistance. METHODS: Through weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), we identified the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM6 as inversely associated with MSI-H status. TRIM6-knockout murine models and subcutaneous tumors were subjected to flow cytometry, RNA sequencing, immunoblotting, and ubiquitination assays to characterize tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), pathway activation, and TRIM6-mediated regulation of the cGAS-STING axis. RESULTS: Hypermethylation-mediated TRIM6 downregulation distinguished MSI-H from microsatellite stable (MSS) gastric cancers.

In addition to surgical tumor reduction, systemic drug therapy is the most important treatment method for metastatic renal cancer. In recent years, immunotherapeutic drugs represented by PD-1 antibodies have been used in the treatment of metastatic ccRCC and achieved good therapeutic effects. However, due to the occurrence of immune escape, only about 50-60% of patients with advanced renal cancer can significantly benefit from immunotherapy. The mechanism of immune escape is extremely complex and has not been clarified. We intend to delve into the driving mechanisms of immune evasion in ccRCC and explore potential targets for intervention. METHODS: In this study, we analyzed the expression of OTUD1 and related pathways in ccRCC through TCGA, GEO dataset, and cBioPortal web tool. At the same time, a mouse model of allogeneic transplanted clear cell renal cell carcinoma was constructed, and the effect of OTUD1 on anti-PD1 antibody therapy was discussed. Experiments such as co-IP, flow cytometry, and RNA-seq analysis were used to investigate the mechanism by which OTUD1 regulates immunity through STAT3. RESULTS: This study reveals that OTUD1 suppresses PD-L1 expression and enhances antitumor immunity in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) by deubiquitinating and stabilizing STAT3, thereby inhibiting its nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity. As a key regulator of the JAK-STAT pathway, OTUD1 disrupts PD-1/PD-L1-mediated immune evasion, offering a potential therapeutic strategy to improve immunotherapy responses in ccRCC. These findings highlight the OTUD1-STAT3-PD-L1 axis as a novel mechanism for overcoming immune checkpoint resistance.

EC differentiation was initially induced using the hanging drop method to promote embryoid bodies formation, followed by embryoid bodies attachment onto culture slides. The expression changes of EC markers during differentiation were assessed by RNA sequencing, Western blotting, immunofluorescence staining, flow cytometry, and reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Functional comparisons of differentiated ECs were performed by assessing LDL (low-density lipoprotein) uptake and NO production. Potential molecular mechanisms were further explored via bioinformatic analysis of RNA sequencing data. RESULTS: Atf3KO led to a significant upregulation in the expression levels of progenitor and mesoderm cell markers on days 3 and 6 of differentiation. By day 9, the expression of mature EC markers also exhibited a notable increase. Moreover, Atf3KO enhanced the functional properties of differentiated Atf3KO ECs. In addition, our findings revealed that the activation of the Rap1 (Ras-related protein 1) signaling pathway, triggered by Atf3KO, contributed to ECs development and maturation. CONCLUSIONS: Atf3KO directs embryonic stem cells toward the mesodermal lineage and activates the Rap1 signaling pathway, thereby promoting ECs development.

The immunoglobulin superfamily 11 (IgSF11) functions as a cell adhesion protein and is overexpressed in several types of cancer, including high-grade glioma. However, it remains unknown whether and how IgSF11 stimulates malignant phenotypes. METHODS: Using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we first examined the expression of IgSF11 gene in various types of cancer tissues. Next, we developed an anti-hIgSF11 monoclonal antibody (mAb) and evaluated the clinicopathological significance of high IgSF11 expression in 187 cutaneous melanoma patients via immunohistochemistry using this selective mAb. We also generated human melanoma cell lines A375 and 888mel expressing IgSF11, as well as 888mel:IgSF11<sup>KO</sup> and 888mel:IgSF11<sup>KO</sup>:IgSF11 cells, and compared their phenotypes with those of control cells both in vitro and in vivo. Immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry was applied to identify an IgSF11-interacting protein, followed by validation of its association with IgSF11 and of the specific IgSF11 region responsible for the complex formation and promoting melanoma cell migration. RESULTS: IgSF11 mRNA was highly expressed in glioblastoma tissues and skin cutaneous melanoma tissues, but not in other malignant tumors. High IgSF11 expression was observed in 57 out of the 187 melanoma cases (30.5%) and was significantly correlated with Clark's level and high budding, both of which are parameters of melanoma invasion. Using a series of established cell lines, we demonstrated that IgSF11 promotes melanoma cell migration and invasion, as well as the enrichment of a gene set associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Importantly, we identified that IgSF11 forms a complex with RAS-associated protein 1 (RAP1). Furthermore, the L372-R378 region of IgSF11 was required for recruiting RAP1 and driving melanoma cell migration.

VC is found to be a powerful and independent risk factor for cardiovascular mortality. Vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) ferroptosis, a form of cell death, is known to be involved in VC. However, whether VSMC ferroptosis is regulated by posttranslational modifications remains undefined. METHODS: We explored the potential role and mechanism of PARP1 (poly[ADP-ribose] polymerase 1)-mediated poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation) in VSMC ferroptosis during VC. Mouse VSMCs were treated with β-glycerophosphate, and Parp1<sup>flox/flox</sup> Tagln Cre<sup>+</sup> calcified mice were generated with AAV9-sh-POLG (DNA polymerase gamma) injected to establish in vitro and in vivo models, respectively. RNA-sequencing analysis was performed to determine the transcriptomic alterations in VSMCs overexpressing POLG and treated with β-glycerophosphate. RESULTS: Both PARP1 expression and PARylation levels were increased in β-glycerophosphate-induced VC, with PARP1 knockdown mitigating VC by improving mitochondrial function and inhibiting the subsequent VSMC ferroptosis. Mechanistically, POLG PARylation levels were increased in calcified VSMCs from PARP1 activation, triggering PARylation-dependent ubiquitination of POLG that resulted in POLG downregulation. This led to mitochondrial dysfunction and Adora2a (adenosine receptor A2A)/Rap1 (Ras-associated protein 1) signaling pathway activation to induce VSMC ferroptosis, which ultimately aggravated VC.

However, the mechanisms driving OC metastasis have not been sufficiently studied. This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms and key molecules promoting OC metastasis. METHODS: Public databases (StemChecker, GeneCards, GEO, and TCGA) were screened to identify metastasis-associated genes. Immunohistochemical staining and western blotting were employed to evaluate THEMIS2 expression and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) marker profiles across experimental groups. RNA sequencing coupled with pathway enrichment analysis revealed THEMIS2-regulated signaling pathways, while immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry was utilized to identify THEMIS2 interaction partners. GST pull-down assays for active Rap1 quantified Rap1-GTP levels under varying THEMIS2 expression conditions. Wound healing and transwell invasion assays respectively assessed migratory and invasive capacities of OC cells following THEMIS2 expression perturbations in vitro. Abdominal cavity implantation metastasis model was established to evaluate OC cell colonization and invasive potential in vivo. RESULTS: THEMIS2 expression is significantly elevated in OC tissues compared to normal ovarian tissues, and its high expression correlates with poor prognosis and malignant features. Experimental manipulation of THEMIS2 levels revealed that knockdown impended the migratory and invasive capacities of OC cells both in vitro and in vivo, while its overexpression exacerbated metastasis. THEMIS2 is involved in EMT and cytoskeleton rearrangement. RNA-seq analysis revealed that THEMIS2 positively correlates with Rap1 signaling pathway. Inhibition of Rap1 activity reversed the metastasis-promoting effects induced by THEMIS2 overexpression both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we uncovered that THEMIS2 functions as a molecular scaffold that recruits TBK1 (TANK Binding Kinase 1) to DOCK4 (Dedicator of Cytokinesis 4), facilitating site-specific phosphorylation at serine 1787 (S1787). This post-translational modification enables DOCK4 to engage with CRKII, subsequently triggering Rap1 signaling activation.

{"id": "mmu04114", "name": "Oocyte meiosis - Mus musculus (house mouse)", "description": "During meiosis, a single round of DNA replication is followed by two rounds of chromosome segregation, called meiosis I and meiosis II. At meiosis I, homologous chromosomes recombine and then segregate to opposite poles, while the sister chromatids segregate from each other at meoisis II. In vertebrates, immature oocytes are arrested at the PI (prophase of meiosis I). The resumption of meiosis is stimulated by progesterone, which carries the oocyte through two consecutive M-phases (MI and MII) to a second arrest at MII. The key activity driving meiotic progression is the MPF (maturation-promoting factor), a heterodimer of CDC2 (cell division cycle 2 kinase) and cyclin B. In PI-arrested oocytes, MPF is initially inactive and is activated by the dual-specificity CDC25C phosphatase as the result of new synthesis of Mos induced by progesterone. MPF activation mediates the transition from the PI arrest to MI. The subsequent decrease in MPF levels, required to exit from MI into interkinesis, is induced by a negative feedback loop, where CDC2 brings about the activation of the APC (anaphase-promoting complex), which mediates destruction of cyclin B. Re-activation of MPF for MII requires re-accumulation of high levels of cyclin B as well as the inactivation of the APC by newly synthesized Emi2 and other components of the CSF (cytostatic factor), such as cyclin E or high levels of Mos. CSF antagonizes the ubiquitin ligase activity of the APC, preventing cyclin B destruction and meiotic exit until fertilization occurs. Fertilization triggers a transient increase in cytosolic free Ca2+, which leads to CSF inactivation and cyclin B destruction through the APC. Then eggs are released from MII into the first embryonic cell cycle.", "genes": ["100039786"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "41144805", "title": "Oocyte checkpoint response to the spindle poison depends on the cytoplasm volume.", "abstract": "The embryonic aneuploidy in mammals may arise from impaired Spindle Assembly Checkpoint (SAC) function, a mechanism which prevents errors in chromosome segregation by blocking anaphase in response to spindle anomalies. Mammalian oocytes are particularly susceptible to these errors, possibly because the large oocyte volume favors dilution of the checkpoint signal, preventing its efficient function. This study aimed to investigate hypothesis that oocyte cytoplasmic volume affects SAC functionality. Oocyte size was manipulated in prophase oocytes (before nuclear envelope breakdown, NEBD) or in M-phase oocytes (after NEBD) by either reducing or increasing cytoplasmic volume by half. These oocytes were then cultured in the presence of nocodazole which activated the SAC by arresting oocytes in metaphase I of the first meiotic division. The functionality of SAC was assessed by measuring the proportion of oocytes escaping SAC-induced metaphase I arrest and completing the first meiotic division i.e., extruding the first polar body and entering the metaphase II of the second meiotic division. Reduction of the cytoplasmic volume in the prophase stage resulted in stronger checkpoint function, with only 4% of oocytes escaping SAC arrest compared to 36% of control normal-sized oocytes. Conversely, enlarged oocytes showed diminished checkpoint efficiency, with 54% bypassing checkpoint-induced arrest compared to 20% of control normal-sized oocytes. Importantly, no such relationship was observed when cytoplasmic volume was altered in oocytes after NEBD. This may suggest that the SAC depends on some nucleus-associated factors that are released into the cytoplasm after NEBD, since such factors would be twice as concentrated in oocytes undergoing volume reduction before NEBD compared to those undergoing reduction after NEBD.

Premature loss of chromosome cohesion proteins and early separation of chromosomes are thought to cause high aneuploidy rates during maternal aging. However, because cohesion loss occurs gradually throughout a woman's reproductive lifespan, and because cytoskeletal defects alone can lead to chromosomal abnormalities, the main causes of the rapid rise in aneuploidy at older reproductive ages are still unclear. In this study, we created a versatile and tunable cohesion manipulation system that enables rapid, dose-dependent degradation of the meiotic cohesin REC8 in live mouse oocytes. By coupling this system with quantitative high-resolution live imaging, we directly observed cohesion protein behavior during meiosis and tested the longstanding threshold model of aneuploidy development. Our results show that premature sister chromatid separation sharply increases only when REC8 levels drop below a critical threshold, supporting the idea of a nonlinear, vulnerability-triggering cohesion limit.

By simultaneous multihour imaging of both compartments of live ovarian follicles, using mice expressing an improved cAMP sensor, we elucidate how the meiosis-activating signal is transmitted.

The typical clinical features of CS are related to hypercortisolism and include accumulation of central fat, moon facies, neuromuscular weakness, osteoporosis or bone fractures, metabolic complications, and mood changes. Traditionally, endogenous CS is classified as adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-dependent (about 80%) or ACTH- independent (about 20%). Among ACTH-dependent forms, pituitary corticotroph adenoma (Cushing's disease) is most common. Most pituitary tumors are sporadic, resulting from monoclonal expansion of a single mutated cell. Recently recurrent activating somatic driver mutations in the ubiquitin-specific protease 8 gene (USP8) were identified in almost half of corticotroph adenoma. Germline mutations in MEN1 (encoding menin), AIP (encoding aryl-hydrocarbon receptor-interacting protein), PRKAR1A (encoding cAMP-dependent protein kinase type I alpha regulatory subunit) and CDKN1B (encoding cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B; also known as p27 Kip1) have been identified in familial forms of pituitary adenomas. However, the frequency of familial pituitary adenomas is less than 5% in patients with pituitary adenomas. Among ACTH-independent CS, adrenal adenoma is most common.

Previously, we observed that orexin-A/orexin type 1 receptor (OX1R) promoted cell proliferation, inhibited apoptosis, and increased cortisol release in adrenocortical cells. However, the functions of orexin-A/OX1R on autophagy and its molecular mechanism are not known. METHODS: Transmission electron microscopy and confocal microscope were performed to detect autophagosomes. Western blot were performed to detect autophagy proteins. The cortisol concentration was assessed with an ELISA. FINDINGS: Our data demonstrated that orexin-A/OX1R activated the mammalian target of rapamycin/p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase-1 pathway, thereby inhibiting autophagy in H295R cells and Y-1 cells. Furthermore, the orexin-A/OX1R-mediated suppression of autophagy played a crucial role in cortisol secretion. Mechanistically, the expression of 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/isomerase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cortisol synthesis, was increased with autophagy inhibition mediated by orexin-A/OX1R. INTERPRETATION: This study provided the evidence that orexin-A/OX1R participated in modulating mTOR/p70S6K1/autophagy signaling pathway to promote cortisol secretion in adrenocortical cell. The findings suggest the mechanistic basis for disorders of cortisol secretion, providing the potential therapeutic targets for hypercortisolism treatment.

Impaired adult hippocampal neurogenesis has been reported in human ApoE4 and ApoE-knockout (ApoE<sup>-/-</sup>) mice.

Cognitive deficits resulting from PAE in offspring are clinically characterized as fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Nonetheless, the exact pathogenic mechanisms underlying these deficits have not been fully elucidated. METHODS: We established C57BL/6J disease models of FAS with doses of PAE (5 g/kg) and primary cultured neuronal cell models (2.5 g/kg, 5 g/kg) to study cognitive impairments and investigate the impacts and underlying mechanisms of FAS. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) in neurons were detected using dihydroethidium staining. The expression of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate (Glu) were examined. Furthermore, the activity of the CREB/BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway in offsprings was assessed. Concomitantly, the superoxide dismutase (SOD) analogue 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidinoxy (Tempol, 0.1 mM) was introduced to the primary cultured neurons to reduce ROS levels, and subsequent changes in the CREB/BDNF/TrkB pathway and GABAergic neurons were evaluated. RESULTS: FAS offspring with cognitive impairment exhibited elevated levels of ROS and malondialdehyde (MDA), indicating PAE-induced oxidative stress. Moreover, PAE markedly decreased the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in offspring, consequently attenuating the activity of the CREB/BDNF/TrkB signaling pathway. Strikingly, the proportion of GABA-positive neurons rather than Glu-positive neurons substantially reduced in the offspring cortex. This decrease in GABAergic expression might be attributed to oxidative stress-mediated downregulation of BDNF, ultimately resulting in cognitive impairment in the progeny. Interestingly, Tempol treatment reduced ROS and MDA content, restored BDNF levels, and counteracted alcohol-induced oxidative damage to GABAergic neurons, suggesting that ROS scavenging could alleviate PAE-related impairments. CONCLUSION: Oxidative stress impairs GABAergic neuronal development via disruption of CREB/BDNF/TrkB signaling cascades, providing new molecular insights into neurodevelopmental pathology in FAS offspring following PAE.

The mechanism of action of Platinum-based drugs involves covalent binding to purine DNA bases, which primarily leads to cellular apoptosis. Their clinical success is, however, limited due to severe side effects and intrinsic or acquired resistance to the treatment.

The drug-tolerant cells may originate from a small population of inherently resistant cancer stem cells (CSCs) in primary tumors. In contrast, sufficient evidence suggests that drug tolerance can also be transiently acquired by nonstem cancer cells. Regardless of the route, key regulators of this plastic process are poorly understood. Here, we utilized multiomics, tumor microarrays, and epigenetic modulation to demonstrate that SOX9 is a key chemo-induced driver of chemoresistance in HGSOC. Epigenetic upregulation of SOX9 was sufficient to induce chemoresistance in multiple HGSOC lines. Moreover, this upregulation induced the formation of a stem-like subpopulation and significant chemoresistance in vivo. Mechanistically, SOX9 increased transcriptional divergence, reprogramming the transcriptional state of naive cells into a stem-like state. Supporting this, we identified a rare cluster of SOX9-expressing cells in primary tumors that were highly enriched for CSCs and chemoresistance-associated stress gene modules. Notably, single-cell analysis showed that chemo treatment results in rapid population-level induction of SOX9 that enriches for a stem-like transcriptional state.

However, the emergence of primary or acquired resistance significantly compromises patient survival. Among the mechanisms contributing to chemotherapy resistance, autophagy plays a crucial role. DnaJ heat shock protein family (Hsp40) member C5 (DNAJC5) is a key regulator of nervous system function. Recent studies suggest that DNAJC5 may also be involved in tumor progression. Based on this, we aimed to investigate the role of DNAJC5 in epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) chemotherapy resistance. Survival analysis of the TCGA database revealed a strong association between elevated DNAJC5 expression and poor prognosis in ovarian cancer patients. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and statistical analyses demonstrated that patients with high DNAJC5 expression frequently presented with advanced International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage and elevated CA125 levels. Functional experiments showed that overexpression of DNAJC5 in A2780 cells markedly increased resistance to cisplatin (DDP). Moreover, cisplatin-resistant EOC cell lines (A2780/DDP) exhibited high levels of DNAJC5 protein expression. Conversely, DNAJC5 knockdown enhanced cisplatin-induced apoptosis and inhibited autophagy in A2780/DDP cells, as confirmed by Annexin V/PI staining, CCK-8 assays, colony formation assays, and Western blot analysis. Further mechanistic investigations using RNA sequencing identified a strong correlation between DNAJC5 expression and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Western blot analysis confirmed that DNAJC5 overexpression upregulated BiP-IRE1α-XBP1 protein expression, which was significantly associated with both increased autophagy levels and enhanced DDP resistance. These findings were further supported by validation experiments using hydroxychloroquine(CQ) and 4µ8C, as well as in vivo animal studies.

Its principal steroidal alkaloid, peiminine (PMI), demonstrates significant anticancer activity. Oxaliplatin (Oxa), a first-line chemotherapeutic cornerstone for gastric cancer (GC), is limited clinically by intrinsic chemoresistance. Natural product-derived monomers represent a promising strategy for developing chemosensitizers to overcome such resistance. However, the potential of PMI to counteract Oxa chemoresistance and its underlying mechanisms remain unexplored, warranting comprehensive investigation. To determine the chemosensitizing effects of PMI in combination with Oxa for GC treatment, specifically evaluating its capacity to reverse chemoresistance and enhance therapeutic efficacy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effects of PMI combined with Oxa versus Oxa monotherapy on GC cells (HGC27, BGC823, MKN45) were assessed using CCK-8, colony formation, and flow cytometry apoptosis assays to evaluate cell proliferation and apoptosis. Subsequently, qPCR-based apoptosis pathway array and transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) were used to differentially expressed apoptosis-related genes and to uncover key signaling pathways mediating PMI-induced Oxa sensitization. The protein expression level of Bcl-2, Bax, PARP, cytochrome c (CYCS), Caspase-3/9, RAS and AKT was determined by Western blot. Finally, the efficacy of PMI+Oxa combination therapy was validated in vivo using both cell line-derived xenograft (CDX) and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models. RESULTS: PMI (50 μM) synergized with Oxa (2.5 μM), significantly enhancing apoptosis and suppressing proliferation in GC cells. Mechanistically, the combination activated the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway by upregulating Bax and inducing the release of CYCS and the cleavage of caspase-9, caspase-3, and PARP. Concurrently, it suppressed the RAS/PI3K/AKT survival pathway by inhibiting Ras-GTP and phospho-AKT. In CDX models, PMI (2 mg/kg) + Oxa achieved a tumor growth inhibition (TGI) rate of > 80.8 %, compared to 20.4 % for Oxa alone. Strikingly, in PDX models which preserve clinical tumor heterogeneity-the combination induced a TGI of > 70 % without exacerbating systemic toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: PMI is a novel dual-targeting chemosensitizer that overcomes Oxa resistance by simultaneously activating intrinsic apoptosis and inhibiting pro-survival signaling.

The gene product contains a central armadillo-repeat containing domain through which it binds the cytoplasmic tail of classical cadherins; meanwhile, it also binds alpha-catenin, which further links the cadherin complex to the actin cytoskeleton either directly or indirectly. Beta-catenin is therefore necessary for the adhesive function of classical cadherins. Another key function of this protein is to mediate the canonical Wnt signaling pathway and regulate gene transcription. Without Wnt signal, cytoplasmic beta-catenin that is not associated with the cadherin complex is quickly phosphorylated at the N-terminal Ser/Thr residues by the so called degradation complex containing axin, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), casein kinase I, and GSK3B, then ubiquitylated by beta-TrCP, and degraded by the proteasome.

In mammals, the JAK/STAT pathway is the principal signaling mechanism for a wide array of cytokines and growth factors. Following the binding of cytokines to their cognate receptor, STATs are activated by members of the JAK family of tyrosine kinases. Once activated, they dimerize and translocate to the nucleus and modulate the expression of target genes. In addition to the activation of STATs, JAKs mediate the recruitment of other molecules such as the MAP kinases, PI3 kinase etc. These molecules process downstream signals via the Ras-Raf-MAP kinase and PI3 kinase pathways which results in the activation of additional transcription factors.", "genes": ["100042555"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "41271031", "title": "Artesunate attenuates pulmonary fibrosis by suppressing fibroblast senescence through inhibition of the STAT3/p53 signaling pathway.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive, and lethal lung disease with elusive pathogenesis. Accumulating evidence implicates cellular senescence as a key mechanism in IPF. Current therapies (pirfenidone/nintedanib) reduce acute exacerbation risk and delay lung function decline in mild-to-moderate IPF, but adverse effects often limit their use. The JAK/STAT pathway is critically involved in the pathogenesis of IPF. While artesunate (Art) alleviates pulmonary fibrosis in rats through anti-inflammatory actions, its effects on fibrosis via STAT3 inhibition-particularly in murine models and human tissues-remain underexplored. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether and how Art attenuates pulmonary fibrosis by suppressing lung fibroblast senescence. METHODS: Pulmonary fibrosis was induced in vivo in mice through intratracheal bleomycin administration. In vitro senescence models included TGF-β-stimulated primary mouse lung fibroblasts and cultured human lung tissue explants. Fibrosis was assessed via hematoxylin and eosin, Masson's trichrome, immunohistochemistry (IHC), immunofluorescence (IF), and Western blot. The expression of senescence-associated markers was analyzed by Western blotting and immunofluorescence (IF). RESULTS: Art significantly attenuated bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice. It downregulated senescence markers (p53, p21), myofibroblast markers (α-SMA), and collagen-deposition proteins (fibronectin, collagen I).

However, chronic inflammation can lead to diseases such as cancer. Curcumin, a bioactive compound extracted from Curcuma longa, has been widely studied for its anti-inflammatory properties. Despite extensive research, the comprehensive molecular mechanisms underlying curcumin's anti-inflammatory effects, particularly its multi-target regulatory network, remain incompletely understood. This study aims to elucidate these mechanisms using an integrated approach combining network pharmacology, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation, and in vitro experimental validation. METHODS: We utilized network pharmacology to identify potential targets and pathways involved in curcumin's anti-inflammatory effects. Molecular docking and dynamics simulation were conducted to evaluate the binding affinity and stability of curcumin with key inflammatory targets. The anti-inflammatory effects of curcumin were further validated in vitro using LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells. Cell viability, NO content, and mRNA expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF) were assessed. RESULTS: Network pharmacology identified 135 potential targets for curcumin's anti-inflammatory effects, with key pathways including TNF, HIF-1, PI3K-Akt, JAK-STAT, and MAPK signaling pathways. Molecular docking revealed strong binding affinities of curcumin with core targets such as IL-6, TNF, IL-1β, AKT1, and STAT3, with binding energies ranging from -6.2 to -7.5 kcal/mol. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated the stability of these complexes over a 100-nanosecond period. In vitro experiments showed that curcumin significantly reduced NO production and mRNA expression of IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF in LPS-induced RAW 264.7 cells, with optimal effects observed at a concentration of 125 μg/mL. CONCLUSION: Our study provides a comprehensive understanding of curcumin's anti-inflammatory mechanisms through an integrated approach.

Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), particularly Yangyin Fuzheng Jiedu Prescription (YFJP), has shown promise in improving patient outcomes, but its mechanisms are poorly understood. This study aimed to elucidate the key components and mechanisms of YFJP in treating HCC using an integrative approach combining network pharmacology, molecular docking, and experimental validation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We analyzed data from 1021 HCC patients (481 treated with YFJP and 540 with Western medicine alone) using propensity score matching to minimize bias. Network pharmacology identified key components and targets of YFJP, with a focus on Jiedu Prescription (JDP). Molecular docking and dynamics simulations validated the binding affinity between core components and targets. GO and KEGG analyses elucidated biological functions and pathways. In vivo experiments using a tumor-bearing mouse model further validated the mechanisms. RESULTS: YFJP significantly improved overall survival (<i>P</i> < .0001) and increased CD4<sup>+</sup>T and CD8<sup>+</sup>T cell counts (<i>P</i> < .05) in HCC patients compared to the control group. Network pharmacology analysis identified JDP as the core component of YFJP, with quercetin, luteolin, and apigenin as the key active compounds. GO and KEGG pathway analyses revealed that JDP modulates HCC through the regulation of cell death, immune response, and the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. In vivo experiments demonstrated that JDP increases the proportion of CD8<sup>+</sup>T cells in the tumor microenvironment and inhibits apoptosis by downregulating the IL-6/STAT3 pathway. Molecular docking and dynamics simulations further confirmed the strong binding affinity of JDP's key compounds to STAT3, supporting their role in modulating this pathway. CONCLUSION: YFJP, particularly its core component JDP, enhances anti-tumor immunity and improves survival in HCC patients by modulating the IL-6/STAT3 pathway.

This study elucidated the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of BRKL against UC through integrated phytochemistry, multi-omics, and pharmacological approaches. METHODS: We investigated the protective effects of BRKL on DSS-induced colitis in mice. Pathological characteristics and oxidative stress of the distal colon were assessed. The impact of BRKL on gut microbiota was analyzed using 16S rRNA sequencing, while metabolomics explored changes in small molecular metabolites. UPLC-QE-MS validated BRKL's prototype compounds in the bloodstream, and network pharmacology predicted its targets and pathways. Molecular docking/dynamics validated target engaagement, followed by experimental validation in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: BRKL significantly alleviated colitis symptoms, restored gut barrier integrity, and reduced oxidative stress. It reshaped gut microbiota composition (Akkermansia, Lachnospiraceae; Escherichia-Shigella) and modulated 22 colon metabolites linked to histidine and JAK-STAT pathways. Network pharmacology identified JAK2 as a core target, corroborated by molecular dynamics showing stable binding of BRKL-derived Withalongolide L to JAK2. BRKL and its active component Isorhamnetin-3-O-glucoside (0.1 mg/g crude drug) suppressed IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 phosphorylation, reduced apoptosis, and inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokines . Structural analysis confirmed Isorhamnetin-3-O-glucoside as a novel JAK2 inhibitor scaffold (Tanimoto index <0.3 vs. clinical inhibitors).

DnaJ Heat Shock Protein Family (Hsp40) Member C10 (DNAJC10, also known as ERDJ5 and PDIA19), involved in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD), has been identified as a tumor suppressor in several cancers. However, its precise role and underlying mechanism in GBM remain unclear. We found that DNAJC10 expression is downregulated in GBM patients and correlated with poor survival outcomes. Overexpression of DNAJC10 reduced GBM cell migration and invasion in vitro, while its knockdown promotes these processes. Moreover, DNAJC10 overexpression inhibits infiltrative growth of GBM cells, suppresses tumor propagation and prolongs survival in xenografted mice. Mechanistically, DNAJC10 regulates multiple molecules and pathways involved in cell motility, including the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway. Importantly, DNAJC10 overexpression decreases EGFR transcription by inhibiting spliced X-box binding protein 1 (XBP-1s). DNAJC10 regulates XBP-1s splicing through the inositol-requiring enzyme 1α (IRE1α) branch of the unfolded protein response (UPR). XBP-1s binds the EGFR promoter and enhances recruitment of SET7/9 methyltransferase, H3K4me3, and H3K4me1. Pharmacological inhibition of histone methylation attenuates XBP-1s-induced EGFR transcription, indicating XBP-1s promotes EGFR expression via recruiting SET7/9 for H3K4 methylation. XBP-1s overexpression reverses DNAJC10-mediated EGFR downregulation. Collectively, DNAJC10 suppresses EGFR transcription by inhibiting the UPR IRE1α-XBP-1s axis, reducing SET7/9 recruitment and H3K4 methylation at the EGFR promoter.

The adenylyl transferase FICD (FIC domain protein adenylyl transferase) is increasingly recognized to regulate BiP activity through the posttranslational addition of an adenosine monophosphate moiety to BiP surface residues. However, the physiological impact of FICD-mediated BiP regulation in the context of cardiovascular health is unknown. METHODS: We assessed 6-month and 12-month-old wild-type and FICD knockout mice in a transverse aortic constriction hypertrophy paradigm. We determined cardiac function and injury using echocardiography, histological stainings, and biochemical approaches. In complementary assays, we used isolated neonatal wild-type and FICD knockout cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts to quantitatively assess cell-type specific adaptations in proteostasis and ER stress responses. RESULTS: We find that FICD deficiency prevents pressure overload-associated heart failure, hypertrophy, and fibrosis. At a cellular level, we observe that FICD-mediated BiP AMPylation blunts the induction of the unfolded protein response and impairs BiP interaction with FAM134B, an ER-selective autophagy receptor, thus limiting ER-selective autophagy induction under stress. In contrast, FICD loss significantly increases BiP-dependent unfolded protein response induction and ER-selective autophagy in stressed cardiomyocytes. We also uncover cell type-specific consequences of FICD activity in response to ER stress, positioning FICD as a critical proteostasis regulator in cardiac tissue.

significant advantages in the treatment of coronary microvascular injury, offering novel therapeutic strategies for cardiovascular diseases. Among its active compounds, Tanshinone IIA (TS) has been shown to regulate mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) function. However, the precise mechanisms through which TS exerts its effects, particularly via METTL3- and SIRT5-mediated unfolded protein response (UPR) pathways in microvascular endothelial cells (MECs), remain poorly understood. PURPOSE: This study aims to elucidate the role of SIRT5 and METTL3 in mediating the protective effects of TS on mitochondrial and ER function in MECs, focusing on the UPR pathways. STUDY DESIGN: Cardiomyocyte-specific knockout and transgenic mice were utilized to investigate the role of SIRT5 and METTL3. MECs from experimental groups were treated with TS, and various cellular functions were analyzed. METHODS: The study employed confocal microscopy, electron microscopy, JC-1 assay, MTT assay, and molecular docking techniques to assess mitochondrial and ER functions. Key markers, including mitochondrial membrane potential, protein expression (PINK1, Parkin, PERK, CHOP, and Nrf-1), and transcription levels (PGC1-α, TFAM, and ATF5), were quantified. Calcium ion levels and mitochondrial respiratory functions were also evaluated. RESULTS: TS treatment enhanced mitochondrial stability, restored mitochondrial membrane potential, and regulated calcium overload through METTL3- and SIRT5-mediated UPR pathways. It upregulated protective proteins (PGC1-α, TFAM, and Nrf-1) while reducing oxidative stress and ER stress markers (CHOP, PERK, and ATF5). Molecular docking confirmed a direct interaction between SIRT5 and METTL3. These changes collectively mitigated microvascular endothelial damage and normalized mitochondrial biogenesis.

It belongs to the so-called relaxin peptide family which includes the insulin-like peptides INSL3 and INSL5, and relaxin-3 (H3) as well as relaxin. INSL3 has clearly defined specialist roles in male and female reproduction, relaxin-3 is primarily a neuropeptide involved in stress and metabolic control, and INSL5 is widely distributed particularly in the gastrointestinal tract. These members of relaxin peptide family exert such effects binding to different kinds of receptors, classified as relaxin family peptide (RXFP) receptors: RXFP1, RXFP2, RXFP3, and RXFP4. These G protein-coupled receptors predominantly bind relaxin, INSL3, relaxin-3, and INSL-5, respectively. RXFP1 activates a wide spectrum of signaling pathways to generate second messengers that include cAMP and nitric oxide, whereas RXFP2 activates a subset of these pathways. Both RXFP3 and RXFP4 inhibit cAMP production, and RXFP3 activate MAP kinases.", "genes": ["100043318"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "39283953", "title": "Relaxin Modulates the Genomic Actions and Biological Effects of Estrogen in the Myometrium.", "abstract": "Estradiol (E2) and relaxin (Rln) are steroid and polypeptide hormones, respectively, with important roles in the female reproductive tract, including myometrium. Some actions of Rln, which are mediated by its membrane receptor RXFP1, require or are augmented by E2 signaling through its cognate nuclear steroid receptor, estrogen receptor alpha (ERα). In contrast, other actions of Rln act in opposition to the effects of E2. Here we explored the molecular and genomic mechanisms that underlie the functional interplay between E2 and Rln in the myometrium. We used both ovariectomized female mice and immortalized human myometrial cells expressing wild-type or mutant ERα (hTERT-HM-ERα cells). Our results indicate that Rln modulates the genomic actions and biological effects of estrogen in the myometrium and myometrial cells by reducing phosphorylation of ERα on serine 118 (S118), as well as by reducing the E2-dependent binding of ERα across the genome. These effects were associated with changes in the hormone-regulated transcriptome, including a decrease in the E2-dependent expression of some genes and enhanced expression of others. The inhibitory effects of Rln cotreatment on the E2-dependent phosphorylation of ERα required the nuclear dual-specificity phosphatases DUSP1 and DUSP5. Moreover, the inhibitory effects of Rln were reflected in a concomitant inhibition of the E2-dependent contraction of myometrial cells.

There are at least three different Wnt pathways: the canonical pathway, the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway and the Wnt/Ca2+ pathway. In the canonical Wnt pathway, the major effect of Wnt ligand binding to its receptor is the stabilization of cytoplasmic beta-catenin through inhibition of the bea-catenin degradation complex. Beta-catenin is then free to enter the nucleus and activate Wnt-regulated genes through its interaction with TCF (T-cell factor) family transcription factors and concomitant recruitment of coactivators. Planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling leads to the activation of the small GTPases RHOA (RAS homologue gene-family member A) and RAC1, which activate the stress kinase JNK (Jun N-terminal kinase) and ROCK (RHO-associated coiled-coil-containing protein kinase 1) and leads to remodelling of the cytoskeleton and changes in cell adhesion and motility. WNT-Ca2+ signalling is mediated through G proteins and phospholipases and leads to transient increases in cytoplasmic free calcium that subsequently activate the kinase PKC (protein kinase C) and CAMKII (calcium calmodulin mediated kinase II) and the phosphatase calcineurin.", "genes": ["102638837"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "41337595", "title": "<i>Drosophila</i> and mouse intestinal stem cells are spatiotemporally specified by Notch suppression and Wnt activation.", "abstract": "The specification of intestinal stem cells (ISCs) during development is critical for maintaining intestinal homeostasis.

Beta-catenin is therefore necessary for the adhesive function of classical cadherins. Another key function of this protein is to mediate the canonical Wnt signaling pathway and regulate gene transcription. Without Wnt signal, cytoplasmic beta-catenin that is not associated with the cadherin complex is quickly phosphorylated at the N-terminal Ser/Thr residues by the so called degradation complex containing axin, adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), casein kinase I, and GSK3B, then ubiquitylated by beta-TrCP, and degraded by the proteasome.

malignancy, poses significant challenges in diagnosis and prognosis due to its complex molecular pathogenesis. Identifying novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets is crucial for advancing treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes. This study investigates the role of synaptotagmin-4 (SYT4), recently identified as an oncogene, in GC development. <b>Methods:</b> We integrated proteomic and clinical analyses to evaluate SYT4 expression levels and their correlations with clinical features. Bioinformatic and clinicopathological assessments further validated SYT4's clinical relevance. Through comprehensive <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> experiments-including immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS), co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), GST pull-down assays, and TOP/FOP luciferase reporter assays-we delineated SYT4's biological functions and interaction mechanisms. Additionally, we investigated the therapeutic potential of borussertib, a specific SYT4 inhibitor, in suppressing GC tumorigenicity. <b>Results:</b> SYT4 expression was significantly upregulated in GC tissues and strongly correlated with poor prognosis. Functionally, SYT4 drove cell proliferation, promoted cell cycle progression, and suppressed apoptosis in both cellular and animal models. Mechanistic investigations revealed that SYT4 directly interacts with PSMC6 via its C2B domain (amino acids 288-423), and stabilizes PSMC6 protein, thereby activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Notably, borussertib, a targeted SYT4 inhibitor, markedly suppressed SYT4 activity, leading to attenuated GC progression. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our findings demonstrate that SYT4 is a critical driver of GC progression via activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway.

This gene is thought to be a potential oncogene because it is overexpressed in a variety of tumors and tumor cell lines. Depletion of this protein in cancer cells has been shown to inhibit cell proliferation and suppress oncogenic transformation; hence, it is a target for cancer therapy.

Therefore, identifying novel therapeutic targets is critical for improving BC outcomes. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have recently emerged as promising candidates for cancer prognosis and treatment, owing to their ability to modulate oncogenic signaling pathways. Among them, the tumor-suppressive lncRNA Nkx2-2as has shown inhibitory effects in certain cancers; however, its role in BC remains poorly understood. To the best of our current knowledge, the relationship between Nkx2-2as and the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway in BC has not been previously characterized. To address this, we used computational tools including lncHUB2, RPISeq, GeneMANIA, TCGA and ENCORI to predict functional interactions of Nkx2-2as, which guided our focus toward its involvement in the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, a key driver in BC progression. We hypothesized that Nkx2-2as may act as a pharmacologically actionable molecule in this context. To test this, MCF-7 breast cancer cells were transfected with either Nkx2-2as siRNA or an Nkx2-2as-pcDNA3.1 overexpression vector, individually and in combination. Overexpression of Nkx2-2as led to a significant reduction in proliferation (~ 85%), suppression of migration, and increased apoptosis. Conversely, silencing Nkx2-2as enhanced tumorigenic properties. Mechanistic analyses revealed that Nkx2-2as downregulates oncogenic targets such as β-catenin, TCF7 and MYC, while upregulating tumor suppressors AXIN2 and BTG2, the latter being a known inhibitor of β-catenin. Western blot analysis confirmed the transcriptional trends, showing decreased β-catenin and MYC and elevated BTG2 protein levels upon Nkx2-2as overexpression. These findings indicate that Nkx2-2as acts as a negative regulator of Wnt/β-catenin signaling through BTG2 activation, suggesting its potential role as a tumor suppressor and a candidate for RNA-based therapeutic strategies in BC.

However, deleterious byproducts of oxidative phosphorylation process called reactive oxidative species (ROS) lead to mitochondrial dysfunction. If the damage is too excessive to be repaired, such mitochondria are selectively recognized and targeted for degradation by a specific mode of autophagy, termed mitophagy. The loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential can induce mitophagy, involving the kinase PINK1 and the E3 ligase Parkin.

To address this, we developed a phyto-exosomal formulation derived from Anemarrhena asphodeloides small extracellular vesicle (AA-sEV) and evaluated its therapeutic potential against diabetic muscle atrophy. METHODS: AA-sEV were isolated by ultracentrifugation and characterized for exosomal morphology. The therapeutic efficacy of AA-sEV was assessed through in vivo studies in diabetic db/db mice and in vitro assays using C2C12 myoblasts exposed to high glucose conditions. RESULTS: Fluorescently labeled AA-sEV efficiently accumulated in skeletal muscle tissue and myoblasts. Oral administration of AA-sEV enhanced muscle performance, as indicated by increased grip strength and hanging endurance, restoration of myofiber cross-sectional area, and upregulation of FNDC5 expression. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that mitophagy served as the central mechanism mediating AA-sEV's therapeutic effects. Specifically, AA-sEV activated the Pink1/Parkin-dependent mitophagy pathway, reducing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species accumulation. This restoration of mitochondrial quality control promoted the MyoG/MyoD1-driven anabolic program while suppressing the MuRF1/MAFbx-mediated catabolic response. Treatment with the mitophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine abolished the anabolic and catabolic regulatory effects of AA-sEV under hyperglycemic conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that AA-sEV mitigate diabetes-induced muscle atrophy by restoring protein anabolic-catabolic balance via Pink1-mediated mitophagy.

In a murine total lung irradiation model (20 Gy), oral FSB (10 mg/kg/day) mitigated inflammation and fibrotic remodeling, improved pulmonary mechanics and arterial blood gases, and exhibited no overt hepatorenal toxicity.

Treated mice increasingly moved to the center of the open field in Y-maze tests and preferred a new arm. Longitudinal <sup>18</sup>F-AV-45 PET-MR scans showed progressive reduction in amyloid tracer uptake, which was corroborated by histologically verified reduced plaque burden and upregulation of LRP1, a key Aβ clearance transporter. HBOT preserved neuronal density and enhanced synaptic proteins. Mechanistically, HBOT promoted mitochondrial quality control by upregulating PINK1 and parkin expression, enhancing autophagosome formation, and modulating mitophagy-associated pathways. The transition of microglia to a surveillance phenotype was reflected in decreased soma area and increased branching. The coordinated improvement in amyloid clearance, mitochondrial quality control and synaptic maintenance, and modulation of neuroinflammation suggest that the ability of HBOT to simultaneously act on multiple pathological cascades-in combination with its noninvasive nature and favorable safety profile-makes it a uniquely promising therapeutic strategy.

{"id": "mmu05412", "name": "Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy - Mus musculus (house mouse)", "description": "Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is an inherited heart muscle disease that may result in arrhythmia, heart failure, and sudden death. The hallmark pathological findings are progressive myocyte loss and fibrofatty replacement, with a predilection for the right ventricle. A number of genetic studies have identified mutations in various components of the cardiac desmosome that have important roles in the pathogenesis of ARVC. Disruption of desmosomal function by defective proteins might lead to death of myocytes under mechanical stress. The myocardial injury may be accompanied by inflammation. Since regeneration of cardiac myocytes is limited, repair by fibrofatty replacement occurs. Several studies have implicated that desmosome dysfunction results in the delocalization and nuclear translocation of plakoglobin. As a result, competition between plakoglobin and beta-catenin will lead to the inhibition of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, resulting in a shift from a myocyte fate towards an adipocyte fate of cells. The ryanodine receptor plays a crucial part in electromechanical coupling by control of release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol. Therefore, defects in this receptor could result in an imbalance of calcium homeostasis that might trigger cell death.", "genes": ["104099"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "40383179", "title": "Exercise-induced dysregulation of the adrenergic response in a mouse model of PKP2-arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Plakophilin-2 (PKP2) is a component of the desmosome. Pathogenic variants can lead to arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (PKP2-ACM). In patients with PKP2-ACM, exercise and catecholamine surges negatively impact arrhythmia incidence and severity. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to characterize remodeling of the sympathetic input and adrenergic response in hearts of PKP2-deficient mice (PKP2cKO) subjected to endurance exercise. METHODS: We used expansion microscopy and structured illumination to characterize the abundance of beta 1-adrenergic receptors (β1-ARs) in the sarcolemma in PKP2cKO-myocytes, sedentary or trained, and Cre-negative controls. We prevented endogenous catecholamine import by short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated knockdown of its transporter [organic cation transporter 3 (OCT3)] and characterized differential effects of isoproterenol (membrane permeable) vs norepinephrine (non-membrane permeable) on Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient dynamics. Separately, we evaluated the distribution of sympathetic terminals in PKP2cKO-trained hearts vs controls. RESULTS: Exercise led to \"increased\" abundance of sarcolemma β1-ARs in control, and \"decreased\" abundance in PKP2cKO-myocytes. OCT3 knockdown drastically reduced the response of trained PKP2cKO-myocytes to norepinephrine but not isoproterenol, indicating preserved response to native catecholamines by intracellular (dyad-associated) receptors in the setting of a reduced sarcolemma pool. In tissue, we observed reduced abundance of sympathetic terminals and heterogeneous distribution across the myocardium. CONCLUSION: Endurance exercise in PKP2-deficient myocytes leads to a reduced pool of functional β1-ARs in the sarcolemma and yet availability of intracellular receptors, which can activate selected (and heterogeneous) routes of intracellular signaling cascades. We speculate that remodeling of nerve terminals affects sympathetic input distribution and hence, regional modulation of excitability and conduction. These changes can facilitate cell-generated triggered activity and heterogeneity of the underlying substrate, setting the stage for life-threatening arrhythmias.", "authors": "van Opbergen CJM; Gutierrez LK; Bertoli G; Zhang M; Boyce S; Deng Y; Cammer M; Liang FX; Delmar M", "fulltext_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12353969/", "keywords": "Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy[MeSH Terms] AND mouse[MeSH Terms]", "llm_relevance_assessment": {"relevance_score": 9, "relevance_level": "High", "species_check": "The pathway is in Mus musculus (mouse), and the study uses a mouse model (PKP2cKO mice), making the species alignment valid and directly relevant.", "evidence_summary": "The study characterizes the adrenergic response in a mouse model of PKP2-arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy.

This study aims to elucidate the patterns of [<sup>18</sup>F]-fluorodeoxyglucose ([<sup>18</sup>F]-FDG) uptake in a mouse model of plakoglobin-associated cardiac disease to better understand its diagnostic potential. METHODS AND RESULTS: Plakoglobin (<i>Jup</i>) knockout mice developed a cardiomyopathy that presented an ACM-like phenotype at 6 weeks of age. Flow cytometry experiments showed a significant increase of immune cells, for example, an expansion of proinflammatory and tissue-injury macrophages. In vivo positron emission tomography and ex vivo autoradiography showed increased [<sup>18</sup>F]-FDG uptake in genotype positive hearts. A correlative analysis between [<sup>18</sup>F]-FDG positivity and macrophage infiltration using CD68 and CD206 staining did not show colocalization. CD68 and CD206 positivity was primarily observed within the fibrotic scar, whereas [<sup>18</sup>F]-FDG uptake was predominantly identified in CD68 and CD206-negative tissue areas. Instead, [<sup>18</sup>F]-FDG signal seemed to originate from cardiomyocytes adjacent to areas of fibrotic remodeling. Morphometric analysis revealed hypertrophy of these cardiomyocytes, which may reflect metabolic remodeling as a compensatory response. CONCLUSIONS: In our murine model of <i>Jup</i>-related ACM, strong cardiac [<sup>18</sup>F]-FDG uptake was detected, which colocalized with regional hypertrophic cardiomyocytes rather than inflammatory cells.

Recently, both phospholipase D (PLD) isoforms, PLD1 and PLD2, were shown to be necessary for efficient FcgammaR-mediated phagocytosis. In this study, we investigated the role of a potential PLD regulator, the Ral GTPases RalA and RalB, in murine RAW 264.7 macrophages. Both Ral isoforms are expressed in macrophages and are transiently activated following FcgammaR stimulation. When Ral expression levels were varied using Ral mutants or interference RNA, phagocytosis assays revealed that Ral isoforms have antagonistic effects; RalA is a positive modulator, whereas RalB plays a negative role. We then focused on RalA and its possible relationship with PLD. The increase in PLD activity that occurs when phagocytosis is stimulated was inhibited in cells with reduced RalA protein, but it was unaffected by reduced levels of RalB. Furthermore, in macrophages transfected with dsRed-RalA and GFP-PLD1 or GFP-PLD2, RalA colocalized with PLD1 and PLD2 at the phagocytic cup during phagosome formation. Additional results obtained from immunoprecipitation of PLD from macrophages transfected with myc-RalA and hemagglutinin-tagged PLD1 or PLD2 indicated an enhanced interaction of RalA with both PLD isoforms during phagocytic stimulation.

Upon FcgammaR activation, Gab2 becomes tyrosyl phosphorylated and associated with p85, the regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and the protein-tyrosine phosphatidylinositol Shp-2. FcgammaR-mediated phagocytosis is severely impaired in bone marrow-derived macrophages from Gab2-/- mice. The defect in phagocytosis correlates with decreased FcgammaR-evoked activation of Akt, a downstream target of PI3K. Using confocal fluorescence microscopy, we find that Gab2 is recruited to the nascent phagosome, where de novo PI3K lipid production occurs. Gab2 recruitment requires the pleckstrin homology domain of Gab2 and is sensitive to treatment with the PI3K inhibitor wortmannin. The Grb2 binding site on Gab2 also plays an auxiliary role in recruitment to the phagosome.

This protein is a selenoprotein containing the non-standard amino acid, selenocysteine (Sec), which is encoded by the UGA codon that normally signals translation termination. The 3' UTRs of selenoprotein mRNAs contain a conserved stem-loop structure, designated the Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element, that is necessary for the recognition of UGA as a Sec codon, rather than as a stop signal. Unlike the other two members (DIO1 and DIO3) of this enzyme family, the mRNA for this gene contains an additional in-frame UGA codon that has been reported (in human) to function either as a Sec or a stop codon, resulting in two potential isoforms with one or two Sec residues; however, only the upstream Sec (conserved with the single Sec residue found at the active site in DIO1 and DIO3) was shown to be essential for enzyme activity (PMID:10403186). In addition, the lack of conservation of the protein extension past the second TGA codon suggests that the one-Sec containing isoform represents the canonical form.

Dysregulation of VSMC contraction contributes to the development of coronary and post-subarachnoid hemorrhagic (SAH) vasospasms. We investigated the molecular mechanisms by which valproic acid (VPA) inhibits Ras homolog family member A (RhoA)-mediated VSMC contraction in rat VSMCs and isolated aortas. METHODS: In rat VSMCs, western blot analyses, quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, ectopic expression of the constitutively active (CA)-RhoA gene or wild-type (WT)-histone deacetylase (HDAC) 5 gene, and inhibitor studies were performed. Active RhoA-GTP levels and Rho-associated protein kinase activity in VSMCs were also measured. We performed a phenylephrine (PE)-induced aortic contraction assay using isolated rat aortas, as well as post hoc analyses of an endothelium-dependent aortic relaxation assay using aortas from VPA-administered mice. RESULTS: VPA decreased the phosphorylation of the myosin light chain at Ser19 (p-MLC-Ser¹⁹) in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Interestingly, VPA significantly decreased RhoA mRNA and protein expression, as well as the active RhoA-GTP level. Furthermore, ectopic expression of CA-RhoA gene almost completely reversed VPA-inhibited p-MLC-Ser¹⁹. VPA markedly increased the acetylation levels of histone 3 (H3K9ac/K14ac). VPA and sodium butyrate but not valpromide significantly decreased the expression levels of both RhoA and p-MLC-Ser¹⁹ in VSMCs. However, this decrease was not reversed by overexpression of the WT-HDAC5 gene, indicating that HDAC5 was not responsible for this decrease. Consistent with the <i>in vitro</i> results, VPA attenuated PE-induced aortic contraction, decreased RhoA and p-MLC-Ser¹⁹ expression, and increased H3K9ac/K14ac levels in isolated rat aortas. The post hoc analysis revealed that the VPA-inhibited RhoA pathway accounted for 30% of the total aortic relaxation induced by VPA. CONCLUSION: This study showed that VPA inhibits RhoA-mediated VSMC and vessel contraction by decreasing RhoA expression, which is mediated by the inhibitory action of VPA on HDACs.

The aim of this project is to define the role of GPRC5C in SMC in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: We studied the role of GPRC5C in the regulation of SMC contractility and differentiation in human and murine SMC in vitro, as well as in tamoxifen-inducible, SMC-specific GPRC5C knockout mice under basal conditions and in vascular disease in vivo. RESULTS: Mesenteric arteries from tamoxifen-inducible, SMC-specific GPRC5C knockout mice showed ex vivo significantly reduced angiotensin II (Ang II)-dependent calcium mobilization and contraction, whereas responses to other relaxant or contractile factors were normal. In vitro, the knockdown of GPRC5C in human aortic SMC resulted in diminished Ang II-dependent inositol phosphate production and lower myosin light chain phosphorylation. In line with this, tamoxifen-inducible, SMC-specific GPRC5C knockout mice showed reduced Ang II-induced arterial hypertension, and acute inactivation of GPRC5C was able to ameliorate established arterial hypertension. Mechanistically, we show that GPRC5C and the Ang II receptor AT1 dimerize, and knockdown of GPRC5C resulted in reduced binding of Ang II to AT1 receptors in HEK293 cells, human and murine SMC, and arteries from tamoxifen-inducible, SMC-specific GPRC5C knockout mice.

To gain further insight into this function of CNN1 in ERK activation and the regulation of SMC contractility in mice, we generated a novel Calponin 1 knockout mouse (Cnn1 KO) by a single base substitution in an intronic CArG box that preferentially abolishes expression of CNN1 in vascular SMCs. Using this new Cnn1 KO mouse, we show that ablation of CNN1 has two effects, depending on the cytosolic free calcium level: (1) in the presence of elevated intracellular calcium caused by agonist stimulation, Cnn1 KO mice display a reduced amplitude of stress and stiffness but an increase in agonist-induced ERK activation; and (2) during intracellular calcium depletion, in the presence of an agonist, Cnn1 KO mice exhibit increased duration of SM tone maintenance.

It is often found in people with health disorders, including obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and cardiovascular diseases. In this diagram multiple mechanisms underlying insulin resistance are shown: (a) increased phosphorylation of IRS (insulin receptor substrate) protein through serine/threonine kinases, such as JNK1 and IKKB, and protein kinase C, (b) increased IRS-1 proteasome degradation via mTOR signaling pathway, (c) decreased activation of signaling molecules including PI3K and AKT, (d) increase in activity of phosphatases including PTPs, PTEN, and PP2A. Regulatory actions such as oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, accumulation of intracellular lipid derivatives (diacylglycrol and ceramides), and inflammation (via IL-6 and TNFA) contribute to these mechanisms. Consequently, insulin resistance causes reduced GLUT4 translocation, resulting in glucose takeup and glycogen synthesis in skeletal muscle as well as increased hepatic gluconeogenesis and decreased glycogen synthesis in liver. At the bottom of the diagram, interplay between O-GlcNAcylation and serine/threonine phosphorylation is shown. Studies suggested that elevated O-GlcNAc level was correlated to high glucose-induced insulin resistance. Donor UDP-GlcNAc is induced through hexosamine biosynthesis pathway and added to proteins by O-GlcNAc transferase.

To study the role of YAP in CFs, we inactivated the Hippo kinases, <i>Lats1</i> and <i>Lats2</i>, in mouse CFs and performed metabolic studies, snRNA-seq, single-nucleus assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with sequencing, and spatial transcriptomics. RESULTS: Metabolic and sequencing approaches revealed that Hippo-deficient CFs activated glycolysis to promote fibroinflammation. Inhibition of glycolysis or lactate production suppressed Hippo-deficient CF-induced fibrosis. Elevated YAP activity disrupted fibroblast lineage fidelity by inducing an osteochondroprogenitor cell state. Blocking macrophage expansion pharmacologically reduced Hippo-deficient CF proliferation and fibrosis. Sequencing and functional studies showed that macrophages secreted IGF1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) to activate IGF1 signaling in Hippo-deficient CFs to increase cell proliferation and fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: We discovered that right atrial CFs are more glycolytic and have higher YAP activity than CFs in other heart chambers. YAP activation in CFs induces glycolysis to drive fibrosis. YAP disrupts fibroblast lineage fidelity, driving them to a SOX9 (SRY-box transcription factor 9)-expressing osteochondroprogenitor cell state. Mechanistically, YAP activates the secretion of CSF1 (colony-stimulating factor 1) to promote macrophage expansion. Blocking macrophage expansion reduces Hippo-deficient CF proliferation, osteochondroprogenitor differentiation, and fibrosis, revealing that macrophages signal reciprocally to regulate CF cell states. Genomic and functional studies revealed that the upregulated IGF1 receptor in Hippo-deficient CFs enables them to receive macrophage-secreted IGF1, thereby further enhancing CF proliferation and fibrosis.", "authors": "Tsai CR; Liu L; Zhao Y; Kim JH; Czarnewski P; Li RG; Meng F; Zheng M; Steimle J; Zhao X; Grisanti F; Sun Z; Wang J; Samee MAH; Li X; Martin JF", "fulltext_url": "https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCRESAHA.125.326480", "keywords": "Hippo signaling pathway[MeSH Terms] AND mouse[MeSH Terms]", "llm_relevance_assessment": {"relevance_score": 9, "relevance_level": "High", "species_check": "The pathway is in Mus musculus (mouse), and the study uses mouse cardiac fibroblasts, making the species alignment valid.", "evidence_summary": "The Hippo/YAP pathway is a conserved signaling network that regulates diverse cellular processes.

BC cells were infected with an overexpressing-ACADL lentivirus to examine the effect of ACADL on BC cell growth. The in vivo impact of ACADL was investigated by constructing a xenograft tumor model. Cells were treated with XMU-MP-1, an inhibitor of MST1/2 kinase, to study the influence of ACADL on BC progression through the Hippo/YAP pathway. The upstream mechanism of abnormally elevated ACADL expression was analyzed by bioinformatics, and EBF3 expression in BC tumors and cells was verified. Regulatory assays were performed to confirm the binding relationship between ACADL and EBF3. RESULTS: ACADL and EBF3 were poorly expressed in BC tissues and cell lines.

Ferroptosis is vital in health and disease, regulating LUAD cell death through iron and lipid peroxidation. How mechanical signals are transduced into the electrochemical determinants that govern ferroptosis remains fundamentally unexplored. METHODS: LUAD cells were cultured on polyacrylamide (PA) hydrogel of varying stiffness to mimic physiological and pathological ECM conditions. Transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) was employed to identify differential expressed genes (DEGs) across varying ECM stiffness conditions, followed by molecular validation of potential regulatory mechanisms through in vitro experiments, in vivo studies, and clinical samples. Based on this mechanistic insight, we aimed to develop nanocarriers for drug encapsulation and assess their therapeutic efficacy in vitro. RESULTS: Our study have demonstrated that elevated ECM stiffness suppressed ferroptosis in LUAD cells. Mechanistically, high ECM stiffness elevated integrin levels, suppressed the Hippo pathway, and increased YAP levels, which upregulated the downstream molecule ATP-Binding Cassette G1 (ABCG1), thereby reducing ferroptosis sensitivity. This mechanistic model was rigorously validated through a combination of stepwise molecular knockdown experiments in vitro, supporting animal studies in vivo, and analyses of clinical patient samples. Notably, dihydromyricetin (DMY) downregulated ABCG1 expression and sensitized cells to ferroptosis, which was further enhanced by nanocarrier-mediated drug delivery for improved therapeutic outcome. CONCLUSION: Our findings revealed a novel mechanism by which ECM stiffness regulated ferroptosis via the Integrin-Hippo-ABCG1 pathway in LUAD.

Mechanistically, YAP, in complex with its transcription factor TEAD, induces its own negative regulator MST1. MST1 inhibition boosts viral replication and reduces β-cell apoptosis, constituting a negative feedback loop in which the reciprocal antagonism between YAP and MST1 balances viral replication and β-cell death during CVB infections.

In this study, we identified ubiquitin-specific peptidase 52 (USP52) as a specific deubiquitinating enzyme of Yes-associated protein (YAP) in CRC, which could stabilize YAP by removing the K11-linked ubiquitin chains.

A central regulatory mechanism of FOXO proteins is phosphorylation by the serine-threonine kinase Akt/protein kinase B (Akt/PKB), downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), in response to insulin or several growth factors. Phosphorylation at three conserved residues results in the export of FOXO proteins from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, thereby decreasing expression of FOXO target genes. In contrast, the stress-activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and the energy sensing AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), upon oxidative and nutrient stress stimuli phosphorylate and activate FoxOs. Aside from PKB, JNK and AMPK, FOXOs are regulated by multiple players through several post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, but also acetylation, methylation and ubiquitylation.", "genes": ["105787"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "40818186", "title": "Reynoutrin activates Sirt1/Foxo3a and Nrf2 pathway via targeting Fyn to ameliorate diabetic nephropathy.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a major complication of diabetes, associated with high mortality and disability rates. Fyn kinase has emerged as a promising therapeutic target for DN due to its antioxidant properties. However, effective therapeutic agents specifically targeting Fyn are still lacking. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to identify a novel natural Fyn inhibitor and explore its therapeutic effects and mechanisms in DN. METHODS: A structure-based virtual screening of 60,556 natural compounds was conducted to discover Fyn-targeting molecules. The interaction between the compound and Fyn was validated by drug affinity responsive target stability, differential scanning fluorimetry, surface plasmon resonance, molecular docking, and cellular thermal shift assay. Therapeutic efficacy was assessed in streptozotocin (STZ) combined high-fat-fed diabetic mice and high glucose-stimulated glomerular mesangial cells. Non-targeted metabolomics was used to explore potential mechanisms. RESULTS: We identified reynoutrin, a natural small molecule, as a potent inhibitor of Fyn from a library of 60,556 natural compounds. Reynoutrin directly interacted with the Fyn protein, forming five key hydrogen bonds that inhibited both the expression and phosphorylation of Fyn. Non-targeted metabolomics linked reynoutrin's effects to the Foxo signaling pathway and oxidative phosphorylation. Mechanistically, reynoutrin activated the downstream Sirt1/Foxo3a and Nrf2 antioxidant signaling pathways by inhibiting Fyn, thereby enhancing the activity of antioxidant enzymes and alleviating diabetic renal injury.

"BACKGROUND: Acetaminophen (APAP) overdose is the leading cause of drug-induced acute liver failure. Sesamin (Ses), a natural polyphenolic compound, possesses diverse pharmacological properties. This study was to explore the effects of Ses on APAP-induced liver injury and the underlying molecular mechanism. METHODS: <i>In vivo</i>, C57BL/6J mice were treated with different doses of Ses for 28 days. After overnight food deprivation, mice were intraperitoneally injected with a single dose of APAP. <i>In vitro</i>, the AML12 and HepG2 cells were pre-treated with Ses and then treated with APAP. RESULTS: Ses dramatically alleviated APAP-induced hepatocellular injury <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i>. Proteomic analysis suggested that the differentially expressed proteins were enriched in ferroptosis, autophagy, and FoxO signaling pathways between the APAP group and the Ses-treated groups. We subsequently found that ferroptosis was significantly inhibited, and autophagy was significantly enhanced in the Ses-treated group. Consistently, Ses obviously reduced the expression of Foxo1. However, hepatocyte-specific knockout Foxo1 abolished the effect of Ses on hepatocyte autophagy and ferroptosis caused by APAP in mice.

METHODS: The chemical constituents of <i>Arctium lappa</i> extracts were identified using UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS. Mouse models of pulmonary fibrosis established by tracheal instillation of bleomycin were treated with Arctium lappa extract, and body weight changes were recorded and lung tissue pathology was examined using HE and Masson staining. Metabolomics analysis was used to identify the differential metabolites and the associated metabolic pathways in the treated mice. The common targets of viral pneumonia and pulmonary fibrosis were acquired from the publicly available databases, and the core targets and active constituents were screened using the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, GO and KEGG enrichment analyses, and molecular docking, and a \"gene-metabolite\" regulatory network was constructed. The expressions of the core targets were detected in the lung tissues of the treated mice using Western blotting.

In the mouse models of pulmonary fibrosis, treatment with <i>Arctium lappa</i> extract significantly improved weight loss and ameliorated lung inflammation and fibrosis.

investigated in vivo and in vitro. METHODS: Co-expression plasmids for stat1/stat3-siRNA were constructed and packaged into lentivirus and adenovirus for cell and animal experiments. Real-time PCR and Western blot analyses were used to detect the expression of STAT1 and STAT3 at gene and protein levels in U251 cells. CCK-8, TUNEL, flow cytometry, and cell scratching assays were performed to detect the therapeutic effect of the co-expression plasmid stat1/stat3-siRNA on glioma in vitro. U251 glioma cells were injected into nude mice to observe therapeutic effect of stat1/stat3-siRNA.Transcriptome sequencing was utilized to further explore the possible mechanism. RESULTS: Treatment of glioma cells and xenograft animal model with the co-expression plasmid stat1/stat3-siRNA led to a significant increase in STAT1 and a marked decrease in STAT3 expression at both mRNA and protein expression levels. Compared to the single-gene stat1 and stat3-siRNA groups, stat1/stat3-siRNA group demonstrated a more pronounced promoting apoptosis of U251, but cell viability and migration, as well as reduced tumor growth in nude mice were not significant. Transcriptome sequencing results indicated that the modulation of multiple nodes within the FOXO signaling pathway may represent the main mechanism by which co-expression of lenti-stat1/stat3-SiRNA induces U251 cell apoptosis.

In this study, we investigated iron metabolism in muscle-specific mTOR knockout mice (mTORmKO) and its relation to their myopathy. The mTORmKO mice exhibited distinct iron content patterns across muscle types and ages. Slow-twitch soleus muscles initially showed reduced iron levels in young mice, which increased with the dystrophy progression but remained within control ranges. In contrast, the less affected fast-twitch muscles maintained near-normal iron levels from a young age. Interestingly, both mTORmKO muscle types exhibited iron metabolism markers indicative of iron excess, including decreased transferrin receptor 1 (TFR1) and increased levels of ferritin (FTL) and ferroportin (FPN) proteins. Paradoxically, these changes were accompanied by downregulated Ftl and Fpn mRNA levels, indicating post-transcriptional regulation. This discordant regulation resulted from disruption of key iron metabolism pathways, including NRF2/NFE2L2, HIFs, and AKT/PKB signaling. Mechanistically, mTOR deficiency impaired transcriptional regulation of iron-related genes mediated by NRF2 and HIFs. Furthermore, it triggered ferritin accumulation through two NRF2 mechanisms: (1) derepression of ferritin translation via suppression of the FBXL5-IRP axis, and (2) autophagosomal sequestration driven by NCOA4-dependent ferritin targeting to autophagosomes, coupled with age-related impairments of autophagy linked to chronic AKT/PKB activation.

When most investigators use the term 'pancreatic cancer' they are referring to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA). Normal duct epithelium progresses to infiltrating cancer through a series of histologically defined precursors (PanINs). The overexpression of HER-2/neu and activating point mutations in the K-ras gene occur early, inactivation of the p16 gene at an intermediate stage, and the inactivation of p53, SMAD4, and BRCA2 occur relatively late. Activated K-ras engages multiple effector pathways. Although EGF receptors are conventionally regarded as upstream activators of RAS proteins, they can also act as RAS signal transducers via RAS-induced autocrine activation of the EGFR family ligands. Moreover, PDA shows extensive genomic instability and aneuploidy. Telomere attrition and mutations in p53 and BRCA2 are likely to contribute to these phenotypes. Inactivation of the SMAD4 tumour suppressor gene leads to loss of the inhibitory influence of the transforming growth factor-beta signalling pathway.", "genes": ["107986"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "41329731", "title": "A targeted combination therapy achieves effective pancreatic cancer regression and prevents tumor resistance.", "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has one of the lowest cancer survival rates.

Likewise, a combination of selective inhibitors of KRAS (RMC-6236/daraxonrasib), EGFR family (afatinib), and STAT3 (SD36) induced the complete regression of orthotopic PDAC tumors with no evidence of tumor resistance for over 200 d posttreatment. This combination therapy also led to significant regression of genetically engineered mouse tumors as well as patient-derived tumor xenografts (PDX) in the absence of tumor relapses.

In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), the mechanistic role and clinical implications of JUP signaling in oncogenic reprogramming remains undefined. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Gene expression and its association with clinicopathologic characteristics and therapeutic resistance of patients with PDAC were analyzed using IHC and bioinformatics and functionally validated by using mouse models. Protein expression and their regulation were measured by using gain- and loss-of-function assays and molecular biology methods. RESULTS: Our immunostaining results and bioinformatics reveals JUP overexpression in pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN) and primary tumors, correlating with advanced TNM staging and diminished survival. Enforced JUP expression promoted PDAC proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro and PDAC growth and metastasis in vivo, whereas decreased expression of JUP exerted opposing effects. JUP expression was positively correlated with FOXM1 expression in PDAC tissues. Mechanistically, FOXM1 transcriptionally activated JUP expression by directly binding to the promoter region of JUP. Moreover, treatment of gemcitabine and oxaliplatin induced JUP expression and subsequently rendered PDAC cells therapeutic resistance, which was reversed by deletion of JUP, whereas knockdown of JUP also attenuated FOXM1-driven therapeutic resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, our findings suggest that JUP promotes PDAC tumorigenesis and progression through FOXM1-JUP transcriptional axis and the combination of FOXM1 and JUP be a more precise biomarker for targeted therapy and prognostic prediction, nominating this dyad as an actionable vulnerability for molecularly targeted interventions in PDAC.", "authors": "Yang K; He Z; Jiang T; Cai T; Li X; Xie K", "fulltext_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12659345/", "keywords": "Pancreatic cancer[MeSH Terms] AND mouse[MeSH Terms]", "llm_relevance_assessment": {"relevance_score": 9, "relevance_level": "High", "species_check": "The pathway is in Mus musculus (mouse), and the article uses mouse models to study PDAC, making the species alignment valid and relevant.", "evidence_summary": "Enforced JUP expression promoted PDAC proliferation, migration and invasion in vitro and PDAC growth and metastasis in vivo...

{"id": "mmu05224", "name": "Breast cancer - Mus musculus (house mouse)", "description": "Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among women worldwide. The vast majority of breast cancers are carcinomas that originate from cells lining the milk-forming ducts of the mammary gland. The molecular subtypes of breast cancer, which are based on the presence or absence of hormone receptors (estrogen and progesterone subtypes) and human epidermal growth factor receptor-2 (HER2), include: hormone receptor positive and HER2 negative (luminal A subtype), hormone receptor positive and HER2 positive (luminal B subtype), hormone receptor negative and HER2 positive (HER2 positive), and hormone receptor negative and HER2 negative (basal-like or triple-negative breast cancers (TNBCs)). Hormone receptor positive breast cancers are largely driven by the estrogen/ER pathway. In HER2 positive breast tumours, HER2 activates the PI3K/AKT and the RAS/RAF/MAPK pathways, and stimulate cell growth, survival and differentiation. In patients suffering from TNBC, the deregulation of various signalling pathways (Notch and Wnt/beta-catenin), EGFR protein have been confirmed. In the case of breast cancer only 8% of all cancers are hereditary, a phenomenon linked to genetic changes in BRCA1 or BRCA2. Somatic mutations in only three genes (TP53, PIK3CA and GATA3) occurred at >10% incidence across all breast cancers.", "genes": ["107986"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "41318133", "title": "Down-regulation of ACSM3 Promotes Tumorigenesis in Breast Cancer.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIM: Breast cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers worldwide.

Functional studies, including migration and invasion assays <i>in vitro</i>, as well as orthotopic xenograft models <i>in vivo</i>, were conducted to assess the role of ACSM3 in breast cancer progression. RESULTS: ACSM3 expression was significantly reduced in tumor tissues compared with normal breast tissues, with down-regulation observed in approximately 75% of cases. Over-expression of ACSM3 suppressed breast cancer cell migration and invasion and was associated with increased AKT phosphorylation. In xenograft models, ACSM3 over-expression inhibited tumor growth and metastatic potential.

The pleckstrin homology-like domain family B member 2 (PHLDB2) has been implicated in cytoskeletal organization and cell migration, but its role in phase separation-mediated tumor progression has not been explored. METHODS: We conducted an integrative multi-omics analysis combining transcriptomic profiling, bioinformatic modeling, and molecular biology experiments to elucidate the function of PHLDB2 in TNBC. Expression, mutation, and copy number variation of phase separation-related genes were analyzed using TCGA, METABRIC, and GTEx datasets. PHLDB2 knockdown and overexpression models were established in MDA-MB-231 and HCC38 cells to assess cell proliferation, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and extracellular matrix (ECM)-related pathways. Immunofluorescence and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) assays were performed to evaluate the phase separation properties of PHLDB2. In vivo, xenograft and pulmonary metastasis models were used to validate the effects of Phldb2 knockdown on TNBC growth and metastasis. RESULTS: PHLDB2 was significantly upregulated in TNBC and correlated with poor clinical prognosis. Gene ontology and KEGG analyses revealed its enrichment in ECM-receptor interaction and focal adhesion pathways. PHLDB2 knockdown inhibited cell proliferation and migration, suppressed EMT by upregulating E-cadherin and downregulating N-cadherin, vimentin, Snail, and MMP-2. PONDR analysis identified extensive intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) within PHLDB2, and FRAP assays confirmed its ability to form dynamic, reversible condensates consistent with LLPS. In vivo, Phldb2 depletion markedly reduced tumor growth and pulmonary metastases and prolonged survival in TNBC-bearing mice. CONCLUSION: Our findings demonstrate that PHLDB2 promotes TNBC progression by mediating ECM remodeling and EMT activation through phase separation-driven signal organization.

We further demonstrated that restoration of BRD7 rescued the inhibitory effect of TRIM25 knockdown on the malignant progression and PTX resistance of BC cells. Furthermore, high expression of TRIM25 was found in clinical breast cancer tissues compared to noncancerous breast tissues, which was positively associated with poor prognosis in BC patients. The expression of TRIM25 was negatively correlated with BRD7 expression, and the combined expression of TRIM25 and BRD7 might be a potential molecular marker for the prediction of malignant progression and prognosis of breast cancer.

Resistance to anti-HER2 targeted therapies remains a significant challenge in treatment. Understanding the role of HER2 in breast cancer progression is essential. METHODS: The proteomics analysis was used to explore the regulated proteins in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. MTS, EdU staininig, flow cytometry and colony formation assays were used to cell proliferation and apoptosis. Protein expressions and interaction of CAND1 and HER2 were clarified by western blot, immunofluorescence and co-immunoprecipitation experiments. In vivo studies using nude mice demonstrated the role of CAND1 in HER2-positive breast cancer cell growth. RESULTS: An increase in CAND1 expression, which is associated with poor prognosis in patients with HER2-positive breast cancer. Functionally, CAND1-KD suppresses the growth of HER2-positive breast cancer cells by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. In vivo, CAND1-KD inhibits tumor growth in xenograft models. Mechanistically, CAND1 expression is positively correlated with HER2 protein levels in breast cancer tissues. CAND1 directly interacts with HER2, stabilizing its protein expression. The E3 ligase CUL7 promotes HER2 ubiquitination and is essential for the interaction between CAND1 and HER2. CAND1-KD enhances CUL7 neddylation, which activates its ligase activity and leads to HER2 ubiquitination. Importantly, HER2 overexpression reverses the proliferation inhibition caused by CAND1 loss both in vitro and in vivo.

The action of prenyltransferases then generates higher-order building blocks: geranyl diphosphate (GPP), farsenyl diphosphate (FPP), and geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP), which are the precursors of monoterpenoids (C10), sesquiterpenoids (C15), and diterpenoids (C20), respectively.

The MEP/DOXP pathway is absent in higher animals and fungi, but in green plants the MEP/DOXP and mevalonate pathways co-exist in separate cellular compartments. The MEP/DOXP pathway, operating in the plastids, is responsible for the formation of essential oil monoterpenes and linalyl acetate, some sesquiterpenes, diterpenes, and carotenoids and phytol.

It is capable of degrading a variety of cellular proteins in a rapid and timely fashion and most substrate proteins are modified by ubiquitin before their degradation by the proteasome. The proteasome is a large protein complex consisting of a proteolytic core called the 20S particle and ancillary factors that regulate its activity in various ways. The most common form is the 26S proteasome containing one 20S core particle and two 19S regulatory particles that enable the proteasome to degrade ubiquitinated proteins by an ATP-dependent mechanism. Another form is the immunoproteasome containing two 11S regulatory particles, PA28 alpha and PA28 beta, which are induced by interferon gamma under the conditions of intensified immune response. Other regulatory particles include PA28 gamma and PA200. Although PA28 gamma also belongs to a family of activators of the 20S proteasome, it is localized within the nucleus and forms a homoheptamer. PA28 gamma has been implicated in the regulation of cell cycle progression and apoptosis. PA200 has been identified as a large nuclear protein that stimulates proteasomal hydrolysis of peptides.", "genes": ["103554"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "41305476", "title": "HBV Infection Drives PSMB5-Dependent Proteasomal Activation in Humanized Mice and HBV-Associated HCC.", "abstract": "Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common primary liver malignancy worldwide, is strongly associated with chronic Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) infection, a significant risk factor. The ubiquitin-proteasome system, central to protein degradation, cellular homeostasis, and cell cycle regulation, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several cancers, including HCC. Despite this, the specific expression patterns of proteasomal subunits during HBV infection and HBV-induced HCC, as well as the association between mRNA expression of proteasomal subunits and proteasomal activity, remain poorly defined. To address this critical knowledge gap, we analyzed mRNA expression profiles of proteasomal subunits in HBV-infected humanized mouse models to uncover HBV-specific molecular alterations. Our findings revealed that the chymotrypsin-like activity (β5) subunit of the proteasome (PSMB5) is consistently overexpressed following HBV infection. Functional studies demonstrated that β5 deficiency decreases MHC I levels on the cell surface and leads to the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, establishing a direct link between β5 overexpression and increased proteasomal activity. Concordantly, HBV-infected patient livers-regardless of HCC status-displayed elevated β5 mRNA/protein levels and enhanced chymotrypsin-like activity. Additionally, analysis of Protein Atlas data revealed that elevated β5 mRNA expression correlates with poor clinical prognosis in HCC patients. In summary, this study highlights how HBV infection induces significant alterations in proteasome function by elevating β5 expression and activity in human and mouse livers. These findings underscore the critical role of proteasomal dysregulation in HBV-associated liver pathology and provide new insights into its involvement in HCC development.

Therefore, developing novel therapeutic drugs and treatment methods to improve the prognosis of patients with NSCLC is critical. PURPOSE: This study examined the effect of Melittin (MEL) on NSCLC metastasis and explored the underlying regulatory mechanisms. METHODS: The effects of different doses of MEL on NSCLC cells was examined using Transwell and wound healing assays. RT-qPCR and western blotting were performed to assess the mRNA and protein expression of proteasome 20S subunit alpha 7 (PSMA7) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition-related genes such as E-cadherin and N-cadherin. A PSMA7 overexpressing lentiviral vector was constructed and transfected into HCC1833 and A549 cells to examine the inhibitory effect of MEL on NSCLC malignant progression. Proteomics analyses were performed to identify differentially expressed proteins in NSCLC cells following MEL treatment. The potential involvement of the ubiquitin degradation pathway was examined using cycloheximide and MG132. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) assays were performed to detect interactions between PSMA7, ubiquitin-specific peptidase (USP)-10, and ring finger protein (RNF)-20. An in vivo lung metastasis model was used to evaluate the effects of MEL on NSCLC metastasis. RESULTS: MEL treatment suppressed the malignant migration of NSCLC cells, as shown in Transwell and wound healing assays. MEL treatment also inhibited NSCLC lung metastasis in vivo. Proteomics analysis showed that MEL inhibited PSMA7 expression. Existing studies have shown that PSMA7 affects EMT process mainly by regulating the protein stability of key EMT factors. MEL downregulated EMT key factors, N-cadherin and upregulated E-cadherin, and it activated the ubiquitin degradation pathway, as shown by cycloheximide and MG132 treatments. Co-IP experiments showed that PSMA7 interacts with USP10 and RNF20. Molecular docking validated the interaction of MEL with USP10, confirming the involvement of the ubiquitin pathway in the effects of MEL on promoting the degradation of PSMA7.

The immunoproteasome (IP), particularly its catalytic subunit PSMB8, plays dual roles in proteostasis and immune regulation, yet has an unclear role in synucleinopathies. METHODS: A total of 232 blood samples from patients with synucleinopathies (PD, multiple system atrophy [MSA], and rapid eye movement [REM] sleep behaviour disorder [RBD]), and healthy individuals were analysed for IP expression/activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and neuronal extracellular vesicles (NEVs), and effects of IP inhibition using flow cytometry. Post-mortem human substantia nigra was examined for spatial distribution of PSMB8. The PD mouse model and human dopaminergic neuron models, combined with transcriptomic analysis, were used to investigate IP changes and inhibition effects. FINDINGS: Consistent upregulation of PSMB8 mRNA and protein was found in PBMCs and NEVs from people with PD, and MSA. This was recapitulated across multiple experimental models, including dopaminergic neurons treated with rotenone, carrying the SNCA-A53T, overexpressing α-synuclein, or exposed to α-synuclein preformed fibrils (PFF), as well as PFF-injected mice model. In human PD substantia nigra, PSMB8 was enriched in the core of mature Lewy bodies, revealing its involvement in synucleinopathies. Pharmacological inhibition of PSMB8 reduced α-synuclein accumulation and apoptosis in PD dopaminergic cell model, and decreased CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in PBMCs derived from patients with PD. Notably, α-synuclein clearance did not align with proteasomal or autophagy-lysosomal pathways, but instead correlated with non-proteasomal trypsin-like activity. In the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell-dopaminergic neuron co-culture model that mimics T cell mediated neuronal cytotoxicity, PSMB8 inhibition further improved neuronal survival, lowered intracellular α-synuclein levels, and attenuated CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell degranulation, linking neuronal α-synuclein burden to immune-mediated toxicity. INTERPRETATION: These findings identify PSMB8 as a key molecular link between protein aggregation and immune dysregulation in PD, supporting its potential as a therapeutic target for synucleinopathies.

In human cultured cells, TMEM177 was found to stabilize COX20 and maintain balanced COX2 levels. In mice, TMEM177 was also identified as an interactor of mitochondrial ribosomes. To understand the function of TMEM177 in vivo, we generated Tmem177 knockout mice.

Although cholesterol elevation links to BCa progression, the specific role of cholesterol metabolism remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that squalene epoxidase (SQLE), a key cholesterol biosynthesis enzyme, drives BCa oncogenesis. SQLE is upregulated in BCa patients and correlates with poor survival. Functionally, bladder-specific Sqle transgenic (tg) mice showed accelerated tumorigenesis, while Sqle knockout (ko) demonstrated opposite effects in vivo. Mechanistically, SQLE localizes to mitochondria and directly interacts with Lon peptidase 1 (LONP1) to stabilize mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) by preventing its proteolysis, leading to elevated oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS). Pharmacological clearance of mtROS via Mito-TEMPO suppressed tumor growth in Sqle-overexpressing models. Importantly, the FDA-approved SQLE inhibitor terbinafine significantly suppressed BCa progression in preclinical models. Our findings establish SQLE as a critical regulator of mitochondrial metabolism in BCa, supporting SQLE inhibitors as potential therapeutics. In bladder cancer, overexpression of SQLE impairs LONP1-mediated TFAM degradation through direct interaction with LONP1, thereby leading to increased mitochondrial OXPHOS and the accumulation of mtROS, which ultimately contributes to tumor growth.

Therefore, rebuilding mitochondrial function is crucial for slowing down the aging process in multiple organs. Kang Shuai Lao Pian (KSLP), a traditional herbal formula with anti-aging properties, has multiple pharmacological effects. Nevertheless, the impact of KSLP on the overall aging state and mitochondrial function has not been explored. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to uncover the effects of KSLP on the overall aging state and reveal the underlying mechanism through which KSLP exerts its effects. METHODS: We constructed aged mouse models to evaluate the multidimensional efficacy of KSLP. Subsequently, with the help of multi-omics joint analysis technology, we predicted the potential targets of the KSLP in modulating the aging of the heart, brain, and gastrocnemius. Finally, we employed targeted metabolomic assays, qRT-PCR, and western blot to validate the molecular mechanism underlying KSLP treatment in aging. RESULTS: We observed that Kang Shuai Lao Pian alleviated the aging-associated phenotypes across the heart, brain, and gastrocnemius by altering seven aging hallmarks, including mitochondrial dysfunction, deregulated nutrient-sensing, intercellular communication, etc. Notably, multi-organ integration analysis identified the Oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) pathway, widely regulated by KSLP in individual tissues, as the core pathway for delaying aging. We further elucidated that KSLP resets the OXPHOS pathway and promotes pyruvate oxidation, improving the coupling of glycolysis and glucose oxidation to maintain myocardial mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. CONCLUSIONS: Our work highlights that KSLP promotes mitochondrial rejuvenation in aged mice by coordinately enhancing pyruvate oxidation capacity and electron transport chain (ETC) efficiency.

Quiescent OXPHOS-high TNBC cells were highly sensitive to BCL-XL inhibitors, but not to inhibitors of BCL2 and MCL1.
