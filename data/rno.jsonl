In RA, abnormal activation of the immune system elevates pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines levels, which can promote synovial angiogenesis and leukocyte infiltration. The synovium forms a hyperplastic pannus with infiltrated macrophage-like and fibroblast-like synoviocytes and invades joints by secreting proteinases and inducing osteoclast differentiation.", "genes": ["114105"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "41197929", "title": "Crateva magna (Lour.)

DC., used in traditional Indian medicine systems such as Ayurveda and Unani, is known for its anti-diabetic, anti-cancer, anti-Alzheimer's, and anti-inflammatory properties. Despite extensive ethnomedicinal applications, its therapeutic role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) has not yet been scientifically executed. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study utilized a systematic approach to examine the effects of C. magna on RA. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Phytoconstituents investigation of C. magna using HR-LCMS-QTOF-MS/MS. Followed by a series of in-silico (network pharmacology, molecular docking), in-vitro (on TNF-α-induced inflammation on SW982), and lastly in-vivo (CFA-induced arthritis model in rats), was adopted to investigate the effects of C. magna. RESULTS: From C. magna, fifteen compounds were tentatively identified. A network was constructed in which six active phytocompounds and the top ten potential targets were scrutinised. Further, GO and KEGG enrichment analysis were performed. The KEGG mapper was used to execute the pathway where C. magna exhibits anti-arthritis effects by modulating the TNF signalling pathway. Further, Molecular docking revealed that all the compounds exhibit good binding affinity towards the target proteins involved in TNF signalling pathways. Lastly, the in-vitro and in-vivo findings suggest that C. magna effectively alleviates the arthritis symptoms and effectively attributes the downstream target genes involved in the TNF signalling pathway. CONCLUSION: Overall, this study concludes that C. magna potentially alleviates RA via downregulating the TNF signalling pathway. This study supports the traditional use of C. magna against RA and suggests it is a good therapeutic candidate.", "authors": "Pattanaik SK; Sahoo S; Acharya SK; Barad PK; Pattanaik S; Rath D", "fulltext_url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jep.2025.120854", "keywords": "Rheumatoid arthritis[MeSH Terms] AND rat[MeSH Terms]", "llm_relevance_assessment": {"relevance_score": 9, "relevance_level": "High", "species_check": "The pathway is in rat (Rattus norvegicus), and the study uses a rat model (CFA-induced arthritis in rats), which is a direct match.", "evidence_summary": ["The KEGG mapper was used to execute the pathway where C. magna exhibits anti-arthritis effects by modulating the TNF signalling pathway.", "The in-vitro and in-vivo findings suggest that C. magna effectively alleviates the arthritis symptoms and effectively attributes the downstream target genes involved in the TNF signalling pathway."], "reasoning": "The article directly investigates the TNF signaling pathway in the context of rheumatoid arthritis using a rat model, which aligns with the KEGG pathway 'Rheumatoid arthritis - Rattus norvegicus'.

arthritis (RA) is characterized by synovial inflammation and bone erosion driven by osteoblast-osteoclast imbalance. Qingre Huoxue decoction (QRHXD), a traditional Chinese medicine, alleviates RA symptoms, yet its mechanism in mitigating bone erosion remains unclear. METHODS: Network pharmacology identified active compounds and targets of QRHXD. Collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) rats were treated with QRHXD or Methotrexate. Arthritis severity (HE staining), bone microstructure (X-ray micro-CT), osteoblast/osteoclast markers (RT-qPCR, TRAP staining), and ATF4 expression (Western blot, immunofluorescence staining) were assessed. Primary osteoblasts from CIA rats were treated with QRHXD or its active compound to validate ATF4 modulation. RESULTS: QRHXD reduced joint swelling, arthritis scores, and bone loss in CIA rats, restoring trabecular parameters (Tb.N, Tb.Th, BV/TV) and suppressing bone resorption markers (TRAP, CTX-1, RANKL). Moreover, the number of osteoclast was significantly reduced. Protein interaction analysis highlighted ATF4 as a core regulator of bone remodeling and potentially regulated by the active compound Quercetin in QRHXD. Both QRHXD and Quercetin inhibited ATF4 hyperactivation in CIA osteoblasts, rebalancing RUNX2 and RANKL expression, with Quercetin showing greater efficacy.

Macrophage heterogeneity plays a crucial role in the progression of RA, but the molecular characteristics and regulatory mechanisms of its subsets have not yet been fully elucidated. METHODS: In this study, we integrated single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data and bulk RNA sequencing (bulk RNA-seq) data, and employed multiple strategies for analysis and identification of the heterogeneity of macrophages in RA. We identified STAT1 as a key gene through a combined approach utilizing LASSO regression and random forest models. The differential expression of STAT1 was subsequently validated in an adjuvant-induced arthritis (AIA) rat model. Furthermore, functional experiments were performed to investigate the association of STAT1 with autophagy and ferroptosis pathways. RESULTS: Based on scRNA-seq data, a total of 26,923 cells were subjected to multi-dimensional analysis. The synovial tissues of RA mice exhibited a markedly elevated percentage of macrophages expressing Stat1. Enrichment analysis indicated that Stat1<sup>+</sup> macrophages were concentrated in inflammatory pathways. Moreover, bulk RNA-seq and animal models further confirmed the upregulated expression of STAT1 in RA. Functional experiments demonstrated that STAT1 activation upregulated synovial LC3 and ACSL4, while downregulating p62 and GPX4. Treatment with fludarabine (Flu) reversed these changes, suggesting that STAT1 may contribute to RA pathogenesis by modulating autophagy and ferroptosis pathways.

Several isozymes of this gene family exist in vertebrates, which vary in cellular location and substrate specificity. This isozyme has a high preference for lipid hydroperoxides and protects cells against membrane lipid peroxidation and cell death. It is also required for normal sperm development; thus, it has been identified as a 'moonlighting' protein because of its ability to serve dual functions as a peroxidase, as well as a structural protein in mature spermatozoa. Disruption of this gene in mouse spermatocytes is associated with male infertility. This isozyme is also a selenoprotein, containing the rare amino acid selenocysteine (Sec) at its active site. Sec is encoded by the UGA codon, which normally signals translation termination.

{"id": "rno04921", "name": "Oxytocin signaling pathway - Rattus norvegicus (rat)", "description": "Oxytocin (OT) is a nonapeptide synthesized by the magno-cellular neurons located in the supraoptic (SON) and paraventricular (PVN) nuclei of the hypothalamus. It exerts a wide variety of central and peripheral effects. However, its best-known and most well-established roles are stimulation of uterine contractions during parturition and milk release during lactation. Oxytocin also influences cardiovascular regulation and various social behaviors. The actions of OT are all mediated by one type of OT receptor (OTR). This is a transmembrane receptor belonging to the G-protein-coupled receptor superfamily. The main signaling pathway is the Gq/PLC/Ins3 pathway, but the MAPK and the RhoA/Rho kinase pathways are also activated, contributing to increased prostaglandin production and direct contractile effect on myometrial cells. In the cardiovascular system, OTR is associated with the ANP-cGMP and NO-cGMP pathways, which reduce the force and rate of contraction and increase vasodilatation.", "genes": ["100361457"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "39613260", "title": "Oxytocin attenuates cardiac hypertrophy by improving cardiac glucose metabolism and regulating OXTR/JAK2/STAT3 axis.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The progress of cardiac hypertrophy is modulated by JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway. Cardiac glucose metabolism derangement exacerbates the progression of cardiac hypertrophy. Oxytocin (OT) has emerged as a significant hormone involved in cardiovascular homeostasis, especially in protecting against cardiac hypertrophy. The present study aims to explore whether the anti-hypertrophy effect of oxytocin is related to the JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway and cardiac glucose metablism. METHODS: Cardiac hypertrophy model was induced by angiotensin II (Ang II) in H9c2 cells and in mice with or without oxytocin treatment. Changes in cardiac histopathology were evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), Masson staining, and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) staining. The hypertrophy-related genes and JAK2/STAT3 pathway signaling molecules were analyzed by qRT-PCR and western blotting. The levels of glucose, pyruvic acid, lactic acid, and lactate dehydrogenase activity in H9c2 cells using the corresponding assay kits. RESULTS: The results showed that OT inhibited hypertrophic and fibrotic changes. Furthermore, OT increased intracellular levels of glucose and pyruvic acid, and decreased lactate dehydrogenase activity and lactic acid levels. Mechanistically, Ang II decreased oxytocin receptors (OXTR) expression and facilitated JAK2 and STAT3 phosphorylation. OT treatment increased OXTR expression and blocked JAK2 and STAT3 phosphorylation The OXTR-specific siRNA-mediated depleted expression could abrogate OT-induced anti-hypertrophic effects in H9c2 cells following angiotensin II insult.

Here, we focus on OT signaling in the dorsal hippocampus (HPCd), a brain region recently linked to eating and social memory, as a candidate system where these functions overlap. METHODS: HPCd OT signaling gain- and loss-of-function strategies were used in male Sprague Dawley rats that were trained in a novel social eating procedure to consume their first nocturnal meal under conditions that varied with regard to conspecific presence and familiarity. The endogenous role of HPCd OT signaling was also evaluated for olfactory-based social transmission of food preference learning, sociality, and social recognition memory. RESULTS: HPCd OT administration had no effect on food intake under isolated conditions but significantly increased consumption in the presence of a familiar but not an unfamiliar conspecific. Supporting these results, chronic knockdown of HPCd OT receptor expression eliminated the food intake-promoting effects of a familiar conspecific. HPCd OT receptor knockdown also blocked social transmission of food preference learning and impaired social recognition memory without affecting sociality.

There are at least three different Wnt pathways: the canonical pathway, the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway and the Wnt/Ca2+ pathway. In the canonical Wnt pathway, the major effect of Wnt ligand binding to its receptor is the stabilization of cytoplasmic beta-catenin through inhibition of the bea-catenin degradation complex. Beta-catenin is then free to enter the nucleus and activate Wnt-regulated genes through its interaction with TCF (T-cell factor) family transcription factors and concomitant recruitment of coactivators. Planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling leads to the activation of the small GTPases RHOA (RAS homologue gene-family member A) and RAC1, which activate the stress kinase JNK (Jun N-terminal kinase) and ROCK (RHO-associated coiled-coil-containing protein kinase 1) and leads to remodelling of the cytoskeleton and changes in cell adhesion and motility.

METHODS: After establishing the rat model of adjuvant arthritis, it was divided into the AA group, the GCK group (80 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>·d<sup>-1</sup>), and the methotrexate (MTX, 0.5 mg·kg<sup>-1</sup>·3d<sup>-1</sup>) group. Meanwhile, the normal group was set as the control. The body weight, overall score, degree of paw swelling, number of paw swellings, and arthritis index of the rats were recorded. Body weight, arthritis score, and paw swelling were measured. Knee joint blood flow was assessed via ultrasound; synovial, splenic, and arterial pathology via HE staining; CD31 expression via immunohistochemistry; and serum levels of IL-1β, IL-6, and VEGF via ELISA. In vitro experiments used TNF-α to stimulate EA.hy926 cells to simulate the inflammatory environment. Scratch healing experiments, Transwell, and matrix gelation tube experiments were used to evaluate the effect of GCK on angiogenesis. The content of VEGF in the cell supernatant was detected by ELISA. The expressions of β-catenin, GSK-3β, p-GSK-3 β, cyclin D1, and VEGF proteins were detected by WB. The nuclear translocation of β-catenin was detected by cell immunofluorescence. RESULT: GCK significantly alleviated synovial inflammation and joint injury in AA rats, inhibited TNF-α-induced endothelial cell activation and inflammatory response, and suppressed Wnt/β-catenin signaling activation.

CKAP4 (cytoskeleton-associated protein 4) has been associated with fibroblast activation; however, its involvement in atrial remodeling and AF susceptibility remains unclear. METHODS: We measured serum CKAP4 by ELISA in 189 patients with drug-refractory AF and 79 controls and then correlated these levels with left atrial scar burden assessed by 3-dimensional electroanatomic mapping. CKAP4 cell-type specificity and AF-associated regulation were evaluated in human single-cell/single-nucleus RNA-seq data sets (GSE238242 and GSE224959). CKAP4 regulation and function were examined in mice subjected to transverse aortic constriction or Ang II (angiotensin II) infusion and in neonatal rat atrial fibroblasts stimulated with Ang II using CKAP4 knockdown/overexpression. AF inducibility was tested by transesophageal burst pacing. Mechanistic studies assessed CKAP4 interactions with wingless/INT signaling pathway (WNT) 3A/WNT5A (co-immunoprecipitation and proximity ligation) and perturbed β-catenin signaling with an agonist (Wnt/β-catenin pathway agonist) or inhibitor (β-catenin/TCF pathway inhibitor) in vitro and in vivo. RESULTS: Serum CKAP4 was higher in AF than controls (<i>P</i><0.001) and correlated with regional and total scar burden (r=0.16-0.29; all <i>P</i><0.05). CKAP4 was enriched in fibroblasts and upregulated in AF in both human data sets. Transverse aortic constriction and Ang II increased atrial CKAP4 in vivo. In atrial fibroblasts, CKAP4 knockdown reduced α-Smooth Muscle Actin (α-SMA), collagen I/III, vimentin, and migration, whereas overexpression produced opposite effects. In mice, CKAP4 knockdown attenuated left atrial fibrosis and reduced AF inducibility. CKAP4 interacted with WNT3A and WNT5A and activated β-catenin signaling; SKL2001 rescued the antifibrotic/antiarrhythmic effects of CKAP4 knockdown, while β-catenin/TCF pathway inhibitor blunted CKAP4-overexpression-induced collagen synthesis and migration.

Sinigrin (SNG) has been shown to possess antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. The present investigation sought to explore the anti-fibrotic effects of SNG against cardiac inflammation and fibrosis through relevant models. An isoproterenol hydrochloride (ISH)-induced differentiation model using HCMEC, HCF, HCM, and H9C2 cells was employed in vitro, while an ISH-mediated cardiac inflammation/fibrosis model was used in vivo to evaluate the therapeutic effect of SNG through molecular biology, ECG, and histological analyses. Gene/protein expression analyses showed that ISH stimulation notably elevated the levels of key inflammatory markers (IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, and cofilin) and fibrotic markers (FN-1, α-SMA, collagen types I, III, and TIMP-1) in the ISH control group. However, SNG (25, 50, and 100 μg/mL) treatment markedly attenuated these elevations in cardiac endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and myocytes. In a rat model, ISH administration (5 mg/kg) markedly elevated injury markers and immune cell levels (ALT, AST, neutrophils, and lymphocytes) in blood samples, along with increased levels of oxidative stress indicators, inflammatory and fibrotic markers in cardiac tissues. Histopathological analysis revealed significant pathological alterations, including inflammatory cell infiltration, fibroblast proliferation, collagen deposition, and cardiomyocyte disorganization. However, SNG treatment (7.5, 15, and 30 mg/kg) effectively attenuated these ISH-induced changes in a dose-dependent manner.

{"id": "rno04910", "name": "Insulin signaling pathway - Rattus norvegicus (rat)", "description": "Insulin binding to its receptor results in the tyrosine phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrates (IRS) by the insulin receptor tyrosine kinase (INSR). This allows association of IRSs with the regulatory subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). PI3K activates 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1), which activates Akt, a serine kinase. Akt in turn deactivates glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3), leading to activation of glycogen synthase (GYS) and thus glycogen synthesis. Activation of Akt also results in the translocation of GLUT4 vesicles from their intracellular pool to the plasma membrane, where they allow uptake of glucose into the cell. Akt also leads to mTOR-mediated activation of protein synthesis by eIF4 and p70S6K. The translocation of GLUT4 protein is also elicited through the CAP/Cbl/TC10 pathway, once Cbl is phosphorylated by INSR.", "genes": ["100364027"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "41271919", "title": "Procyanidin A2, a polyphenol autophagy-enhancer, ameliorates hyperglycemia through multifaceted insulin-related mechanisms.", "abstract": "Procyanidin A2 (PCA2), a flavonoid from cranberries and lingonberries, has shown various bioactivities, but its antidiabetic effects remain largely under-investigated.

Roles of Adipocytokines, PI3K/AKT, and AMPK Signaling Pathways.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND/AIM: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a prevalent disorder characterized by an increased concentration of blood glucose and impaired insulin function. Throughout the course of the disease, β-cell function fails and insulin production decreases. Studying the molecular systems responsible for insulin production, release, and action is crucial for the management and treatment of the disease. Thus, this study aimed to scrutinize the therapeutic efficacies of oxytocin (OXT) on nicotinamide (NA)/streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes in rats and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Wistar rats were supplied a single intraperitoneal (<i>i.p.</i>) dose of NA (120 mg/kg) 15 min before an <i>i.p.</i> injection of STZ (60 mg/kg) after fasting for 16 h. Ten days later, the diabetic rats were orally administered OXT every day for eight weeks at dose levels 0.5, 1, and 2 IU/kg. RESULTS: The treatment of diabetic rats with OXT significantly improved oral glucose tolerance, serum insulin and C-peptide concentrations, and pancreatic islets' structure and function. Furthermore, the activities of liver glucose-6-phospatase and glycogen phosphorylase significantly decreased. OXT treatment also resulted in an increase in serum adiponectin levels, while the levels of serum resistin, omentin, vaspin, and free fatty acids significantly decreased. Additionally, OXT significantly alleviated the mRNA levels of components of the PI3K-AKT and AMPK signaling pathways as well as their effectors including PPARγ, insulin receptor (IR), IR substrates 1 and 2 (IRS1 & IRS2), PI3K, AKT, AMPK, and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) in visceral adipose tissues of diabetic rats. CONCLUSION: OXT can exert antidiabetic effects and may be useful for developing multiple targeted therapeutic strategies for diabetes treatment.

increased risk of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM). However, it remains unclear whether exposure to DEHP and its active metabolite can disrupt metabolic homeostasis by inducing pancreatic β-cell dedifferentiation. To evaluate the effects of DEHP on glucose homeostasis and β-cell dedifferentiation, we established an in vivo exposure model using male SD rats, administered with varying concentrations of DEHP (0, 2, 20 and 200 mg/kg/day) over six weeks. Our findings suggest that DEHP exposure leads to elevated blood glucose levels, insulin resistance, and β-cell dedifferentiation, which are associated with the suppression of the PI3K/Akt/FoxO1 signaling pathway. Subsequent in vitro experiments demonstrated that exposure of INS-1 cells to mono (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), the primary bioactive metabolite of DEHP, impaired glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS). This impairment was associated with β-cell dedifferentiation, the nuclear translocation of FoxO1, and suppression of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway.

The carbon dioxide, which is generated in the cells and enters from the blood, is changed to carbonic acid. This carbonic acid is divided into hydrogen ion and bicarbonate ion. Intracellular CA II catalyses the formation of these ions. The hydrogen ion is secreted into the lumen by the luminal H(+)-ATPase.

This isozyme has a high preference for lipid hydroperoxides and protects cells against membrane lipid peroxidation and cell death.

Sec is encoded by the UGA codon, which normally signals translation termination. The 3' UTRs of selenoprotein mRNAs contain a conserved stem-loop structure, designated the Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element, that is necessary for the recognition of UGA as a Sec codon, rather than as a stop signal.

Macrophages, the most prevalent leucocyte found in nephrolithiasis, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of kidney stones. METHODS: Using oxalate (Ox) induction to simulate the hyperoxaluria microenvironment in vivo, fisetin was administered to human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (HK-2 cells). The senescence of HK-2 cells was evaluated by detecting SA-β-gal staining, expression of senescence markers p16 and p53, and levels of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) molecules. THP-1 cells were differentiated into macrophages (M0-MΦs) using PMA induction, and macrophages in different polarization states (M1-like phenotype, M2-like phenotype) were treated with the supernatant from HK-2 cell culture. siRNA gene knockdown technology was applied to evaluate the activity of the LXN/Rps3/p53 pathway during oxalate-induced senescence in HK-2 cells. A rat model of calcium oxalate crystal-induced kidney injury was established, and the rats were divided into following groups: PBS, oxalate, oxalate + fisetin, oxalate + transfection with LXN-knockdown adeno-associated virus (AAV-shLXN), and oxalate + fisetin + AAV-shLXN, Histological assessment was performed using HE staining and Von Kossa staining of kidney tissues. The expression levels of LXN, Rps3, p53, iNOS, and CD163 in renal tissues were evaluated by immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: The onset of RTEC senescence was increased after treatment with oxalate, and the increase in RTEC senescence was reduced by fisetin treatment. Interestingly, the changes in proinflammatory M1-like phenotype polarization induced by culture medium from HK-2 cells treated with Ox+/-fisetin were consistent with the proportion of senescent HK-2 cells cultured.

While adenine, a purine compound, exhibits anti-inflammatory properties, its effects on VSMC inflammation remain poorly characterized. This investigation examined adenine's impact on proinflammatory mediators in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated rat aortic smooth muscle cells (A7r5) and elucidated the underlying mechanisms. Cell viability, gene expression, cytokine secretion, and signaling pathways were evaluated using MTT assay, qPCR, ELISA, and western blotting techniques. Results demonstrated that adenine concentrations ≤400 μM maintained A7r5 cell viability while significantly suppressing LPS-induced mRNA expression and protein production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1β, and IL-8. Additionally, LPS increased inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression and nitric oxide production. Mechanistic analysis revealed that LPS treatment reduced p53 phosphorylation while enhancing ERK, JNK, and p38 phosphorylation alongside NF-κB activation. Co-treatment with adenine and LPS activated AMPK signaling, increased p53 phosphorylation, and simultaneously reduced ERK phosphorylation and NF-κB activation. AMPK inhibition abolished adenine-induced p53 phosphorylation, restored ERK and NF-κB activation, and reversed the suppression of proinflammatory mediator production. Furthermore, combined inhibition of ERK, NF-κB, and p53 pathways enhanced adenine's inhibitory effects on NF-κB activation and inflammatory mediator production.

This unique herbal compound has been clinically applied for years in treating thyroid diseases, demonstrating remarkable therapeutic efficacy with low adverse effects and recurrence rates. However, its underlying mechanisms remain unclear. AIMS: This study elucidates the therapeutic effects of HZXLJN on hypothyroidism (HT) via the ferroptosis pathway using an integrated strategy of network pharmacology, multi-omics analysis, and in vitro experiments. METHODS: The chemical composition of HZXLJN was analyzed using mass spectrometry. Network pharmacology, proteomics, and metabolomics were integrated in a multi-omics approach to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying HZXLJN's therapeutic effects on HT. Animal experiments were conducted to screen potential therapeutic pathways. A hypothyroidism rat model was established in SD rats using propylthiouracil (PTU), followed by intervention with either HZXLJN, levothyroxine sodium (LS), or Ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1), with subsequent observation of rat conditions; Histopathological evaluation of thyroid tissue was performed using hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining. Serum hormone levels and biochemical parameters were assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and biochemical assays. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was employed to examine GPX4 protein expression in thyroid tissue. The mitochondrial status of thyroid follicular cells was observed via transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Western blot (WB) analysis was conducted to detect the expression of pathway-related proteins in thyroid tissue. In vitro, a ferroptosis cell model was established in Nthy-ori 3-1 cells by Erastin induction to screen for the specific active components of HZXLJN, followed by investigation of the underlying mechanisms through immunofluorescence (IF) and Western blot (WB) analyses. RESULTS: HZXLJN contains nine active components. Network pharmacology predicted AKT and p53 as its primary therapeutic targets. Proteomic and metabolomic analyses suggested its therapeutic effects may be associated with ferroptosis, preliminarily identifying five ferroptosis-related pathways: glutathione metabolism, lipid metabolism, mitochondrial function, heme metabolism, and autophagolysosome activity. Animal experiments demonstrated that HZXLJN ameliorated PTU-induced hypothyroidism in SD rats. Through GPX4 level assessment and transmission electron microscopy, we confirmed that HZXLJN improved hypothyroidism by inhibiting ferroptosis. Further validation via Western blot and biochemical assays of the multi-omics-identified ferroptosis pathways determined that HZXLJN primarily exerts its effects by modulating the glutathione metabolism pathway. In vitro experiments demonstrated that the active components of HZXLJN are Nobiletin, Hesperetin, and Berberine, which inhibit ferroptosis primarily by suppressing the p53 pathway. CONCLUSION: Hai Zao Xiao Liu Jiao Nang (HZXLJN) may alleviate hypothyroidism (HT) by inhibiting ferroptosis, primarily through three active components - Nobiletin, Hesperetin, and Berberine.

Several isozymes of this gene family exist in vertebrates, which vary in cellular location and substrate specificity. This isozyme has a high preference for lipid hydroperoxides and protects cells against membrane lipid peroxidation and cell death. It is also required for normal sperm development; thus, it has been identified as a 'moonlighting' protein because of its ability to serve dual functions as a peroxidase, as well as a structural protein in mature spermatozoa. Disruption of this gene in mouse spermatocytes is associated with male infertility. This isozyme is also a selenoprotein, containing the rare amino acid selenocysteine (Sec) at its active site. Sec is encoded by the UGA codon, which normally signals translation termination. The 3' UTRs of selenoprotein mRNAs contain a conserved stem-loop structure, designated the Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element, that is necessary for the recognition of UGA as a Sec codon, rather than as a stop signal.

Exosomes derived from umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UCMSCs) have emerged as promising therapeutic agents in regenerative medicine and anti-aging research due to their bioactive cargo and low immunogenicity. This study investigated the rejuvenating potential of UCMSCs-derived exosomes (UCMSC-Exos) on senescent jaw bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (JBMMSCs) and their ability to enhance bone repair in aged rats. METHODS: Senescent JBMMSCs were treated with UCMSC-Exos, and their effects on cellular senescence, proliferation, migration, and osteogenic capability were assessed using senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) staining, CCK8 assays, scratch assays, alizarin red S staining, alkaline phosphatase staining, RT-qPCR, ELISA and western blotting. The underlying mechanisms were explored through western blot analysis of autophagy markers and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. For in vivo evaluation, calvarial defect models were established in aged rats, and the bone repair efficacy of UCMSC-Exos was assessed by micro-CT, histological staining, immunohistochemical staining for OCN and ALP, and immunofluorescence staining for OPN and OSX. RESULTS: UCMSC-Exos treatment markedly attenuated cellular senescence in JBMMSCs, as demonstrated by decreased SA-β-gal-positive cells and downregulation of key senescence-associated proteins (p53, p21, and p16) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-α). The exosome-treated cells showed significant improvements in proliferative capacity, migratory ability, and osteogenic differentiation potential compared to untreated controls. Mechanistically, UCMSC-Exos restored autophagy through modulation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, as demonstrated by altered protein expression. In rat calvarial defect models, UCMSC-Exos treatment resulted in better bone repair in aged rats. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that UCMSC-Exos could rejuvenate senescent JBMMSCs by activating autophagy via the regulation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, and enhance bone repair in aged rats.

{"id": "rno04620", "name": "Toll-like receptor signaling pathway - Rattus norvegicus (rat)", "description": "Specific families of pattern recognition receptors are responsible for detecting microbial pathogens and generating innate immune responses. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are membrane-bound receptors identified as homologs of Toll in Drosophila. Mammalian TLRs are expressed on innate immune cells, such as macrophages and dendritic cells, and respond to the membrane components of Gram-positive or Gram-negative bacteria. Pathogen recognition by TLRs provokes rapid activation of innate immunity by inducing production of proinflammatory cytokines and upregulation of costimulatory molecules. TLR signaling pathways are separated into two groups: a MyD88-dependent pathway that leads to the production of proinflammatory cytokines with quick activation of NF-{kappa}B and MAPK, and a MyD88-independent pathway associated with the induction of IFN-beta and IFN-inducible genes, and maturation of dendritic cells with slow activation of NF-{kappa}B and MAPK.", "genes": ["100361294"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "41326463", "title": "Exploratory study on the efficacy of Lingze mixture in gouty arthritis rats and preliminary analysis of its potential mechanisms via transcriptome sequencing.", "abstract": "Lingze mixture (LM), a traditional Chinese herbal formula, has demonstrated clinical efficacy in treating gouty arthritis (GA). However, its pharmacological mechanisms remain largely unexplored. This study aimed to conduct an exploratory investigation into the anti-inflammatory effects of LM in a GA rat model and to preliminarily identify potential signaling pathways involved through transcriptome analysis. A rat GA model was induced by monosodium urate (MSU) injection. Animals were treated with LM at low, medium, or high doses, with etoricoxib as a positive control. Synovial inflammation was assessed histologically (H&E staining). Protein expression of TLR4, MyD88, and NF-κB was detected by immunohistochemistry (IHC). To generate mechanistic hypotheses, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed on synovial tissues from the blank, model, and medium-dose LM groups. LM treatment significantly attenuated MSU-induced synovitis and dose-dependently reduced the protein levels of TLR4, MyD88, and NF-κB. Transcriptome analysis revealed significant enrichment of the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB and MAPK signaling pathways in the model group. Notably, medium-dose LM treatment appeared to modulate these pathways, along with alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism. Our findings confirm the anti-gout efficacy of LM in vivo and provide preliminary evidence suggesting its action may be associated with the modulation of the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway.

METHODS: Bioinformatics and network pharmacology analysis revealedCIRI-related targets of Tanshinone IIA.

Moreover, molecular docking and 100 ns molecular dynamics simulations assessed Tanshinone IIA binding to core proteins.

Galectin-3 (Gal-3), an indicator of inflammation and fibrosis, has been implicated in the pathogenesis of arteriogenic ED. In this study, we investigate the role of Gal-3 in CNI-ED and explore the potential mechanisms by which adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cell exosomes (ADSC-Exo) ameliorate CNI-ED. METHODS: We established a bilateral CNI (BCNI) rat model and evaluated erectile function using intracavernous pressure (ICP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and infrared ray thermography (IRT). The expression level of Gal-3 was measured in the major pelvic ganglia (MPG), penile corpus cavernosum, and cultured cells, with its expression modulated by lentiviral vectors. A combination of experimental approaches, including western blot, immunofluorescence, and flow cytometry analysis, were employed to investigate the role of Gal-3 in the progression of CNI-ED. Additionally, the potential molecular mechanisms by which ADSC-Exo ameliorates CNI-ED were explored. RESULTS: Our findings indicated that the expression of Gal-3 is significantly upregulated in the MPG and penile corpus cavernosum of BCNI rats. This upregulation was accompanied by oxidative stress and activation of the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB signaling pathway. Following lentiviral knockdown of Gal-3, erectile function in BCNI rats was improved. Moreover, ADSC-Exo transplantation inhibited Gal-3 expression and the related inflammatory profibrotic cascades.

However, its protective role in myocardial infarction (MI)-induced cardiac injury remains unclear. PURPOSE: The present study sought to clarify whether 10-HDA mitigates MI-induced cardiac injury via regulation of the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway-a key innate immune inflammatory mediator. METHODS: For in vivo and in vitro assessment of 10-HDA's cardioprotection, we utilized a murine MI model and hypoxic neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs). Cardiac function, histology, inflammatory cytokines, and oxidative stress markers were evaluated. To examine TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway modulation, Western blotting, immunofluorescence, and co-immunoprecipitation were employed. TLR4 dependence of 10-HDA was verified using the specific inhibitor TAK242. Furthermore, the regulatory effect of 10-HDA on macrophage-mediated myocardial inflammatory injury was evaluated a conditioned medium experiment. RESULTS: 10-HDA improved cardiac function in MI mice in a dose-dependent manner, accompanied by significant reductions in cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, cardiac fibrosis, inflammatory cell infiltration, and oxidative stress. Similar protective effects were observed in hypoxia-treated NRCMs. At the mechanistic level, 10-HDA suppressed MI- or hypoxia-induced TLR4 and MyD88 upregulation, decreased IκBα phosphorylation and degradation, prevented NF-κB nuclear translocation, and downregulated pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. Co-immunoprecipitation assay confirmed reduced TLR4-MyD88 interaction. Moreover, results from TAK242 intervention demonstrated that 10-HDA mediates its cardioprotective effects primarily via inhibition of the TLR4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway.

Here the role of adiposomes in GPI-protein-mediated information transfer was studied. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Adiposomes were incubated with isolated rat adipocytes under various conditions. Trafficking of CD73 and lipid synthesis were analysed. KEY RESULTS: Upon blockade of GPI-protein trafficking, CD73 specifically associated with DIGs of small, and to a lower degree, large, adipocytes.

This study aims at evaluation of the CV changes in the rats of different ages and assessment of the contribution of cellular and tissue factors into CV. METHODS: The CV was determined in 3-, 12- and 24-month-old anesthetized rats using epicardial mapping under ventricular stimulation. The contribution of gap junction functionality to CV was assessed using carbenoxolone, an uncoupling agent for Cx43. The measurement of sodium ion current (I<sub>Na</sub>) was performed in isolated ventricular cardiomyocytes using the patch-clamp technique. Expression of gene transcripts encoding Cx43 (GJA1a) and sodium currents (SCN5a) were assessed using RT-PCR analysis. RESULTS: The baseline longitudinal conduction velocity (CV<sub>L</sub>) did not differ between 3-, 12- and 24-month-old groups. Intravenous administration of carbenoxolone decreased the CV<sub>L</sub> only in the 3-month-old animals. The density of sodium current (I<sub>Na</sub>) of 24-month-old rats was greater as compared to 3-month-old rats. The extent of fibrosis was less prominent in 3-month-old rats than in the older animals.

Our team's previous research has found that loganin isolated from Cornus officinalis has an antidepressant effect. Depression is a mental disorder accompanied by dysfunction of Connexin43 (Cx43)-formed astrocytic gap junctions. However, the precise mechanisms of loganin involved remain uncertain. AIM OF THE STUDY: We aimed to examine the mechanism by which loganin produces its antidepressant properties. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a chronic unpredictable stress (CUS) model of depression in rats, the study evaluated the behavioral responses to treatment with loganin, fluoxetine, and their combination. Biochemical analyses were conducted to measure the expression and phosphorylation status of Cx43, β-catenin, GSK-3β in the brain. In vitro experiments were also performed how loganin protects the gap junctions in astrocytes that have been exposed to corticosterone. RESULTS: After four weeks of loganin treatment, rats exposed to CUS showed a decrease in depressive-like behaviors. When combined with fluoxetine, the antidepressant-like effects were observed faster than with either treatment alone. Loganin significantly increased Cx43 expression in the prefrontal cortex and ventral hippocampus, reversed Cx43 mimetic peptide Gap26-induced depressive-like behaviors, decreased Cx43 phosphorylation at Ser368, increased β-catenin levels, and promoted GSK-3β phosphorylation at Ser9. In vitro, loganin prevented corticosterone-induced damage to gap junctions between astrocytes, an effect that was negated by XAV-939 (β-catenin inhibitor). CONCLUSION: These results implied that loganin could exert antidepressant-like effects by improving the gap junctions of astrocytes in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, acting through the GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling pathway.

The examination of cell proliferation was conducted employing CCK8. TUNEL staining was used to monitor cell apoptosis. Western blot analysis was used to determine the protein profiles of apoptosis-concerned related proteins (including Mcl1, Bcl-XL, and Caspase-3), the NF-κB, Nrf2/HO-1, and Rap1 signaling pathways. ELISA confirmed the levels of the inflammatory factors IL-6, TNF-α, MCP1, and ICAM1.

Cocaine binds strongly to the dopamine-reuptake transporter, preventing the reuptake of dopamine into the nerve terminal. Because of this blocking effect, dopamine remains at high concentrations in the synapse and continues to affect adjacent neurons, producing the characteristic cocaine \"high.\" Activated D1 receptor activates the PKA signaling pathway, and this pathway plays a critical role in mediating the behavioral responses to cocaine administration. Cocaine-induced neuroadaptations, including dopamine depletion, may underlie craving and hedonic dysregulation.", "genes": ["100360880"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "41224753", "title": "Cocaine seeking and consumption are oppositely regulated by mesolimbic dopamine in male rats.", "abstract": "Drug-associated stimuli (cues) can usurp potent control of behavior in individuals with substance use disorders; and these effects are often attributed to altered dopamine transmission. However, there is much debate over the way in which dopamine signaling changes over the course of chronic drug use.

We show that, in a subset of individuals that exhibit increased cue reactivity and escalated drug consumption, this signaling undergoes diametrically opposed changes in amplitude, determined by the context in which the cue was presented. Dopamine evoked by non-contingent cue presentation (independent of the animal's actions) increases over drug use, producing greater cue reactivity; whereas dopamine evoked by contingent cue presentation (dependent on the animal's actions) decreases over drug use, producing escalation of drug consumption.

While short-acting glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) reduces cocaine-related behaviors, its impact is limited by low affinity towards GLP-1R. Semaglutide may be beneficial in this context as it is long-acting with greater potency and affinity for the GLP-1R. Its superiority is substantiated in studies on alcohol and alcohol use disorder (AUD) as it profoundly reduces alcohol intake in animals and patients with AUD, whereas exendin-4 (Ex4) slightly reduces alcohol intake in rats, whereas it does not alter alcohol intake in AUD patients. However, it remains to be explored whether its beneficial effects extend to more complex cocaine-related behaviors, the aim of the present study. Using the cocaine self-administration paradigm in male rats, we tested the efficacy of different doses of semaglutide to reduce voluntary cocaine taking, the motivation to consume cocaine, and the reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior. Furthermore, we explored the effects of semaglutide on cocaine-evoked dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). Semaglutide decreased cocaine self-administration, the motivation to consume cocaine, and cocaine reinstatement in male rats. Moreover, semaglutide attenuated cocaine-induced elevation of dopamine levels in mice and rats.

Cocaine exerts its effects - in part - by blocking dopamine transporters (DAT) and subsequently dysregulating DAT function. Several molecular targets have been identified as key regulators of DAT function and expression including dopamine D3 receptors (D3R) that are highly expressed in the mesolimbic dopamine pathway. Although D3R partial agonists and antagonists have been shown to influence cocaine seeking in rodents, effects have been inconsistent with studies reporting varying outcomes on cocaine-associated behavior. In this study, we tested the effects of SK609, a novel G-protein biased D3R agonist, and pramipexole, an unbiased agonist of D3R, on DAT expression and function and cocaine-seeking behavior. Results indicated that SK609 reduced phosphorylation of DATs following cocaine and the uptake inhibition effects of cocaine on dopamine transmission in <i>in vitro</i> and <i>ex vivo</i> studies, respectively. By comparison, pramipexole augmented the effects of cocaine on DAT phosphorylation, enhanced dopamine levels, and increased cocaine seeking in rats.

One key impediment to successful treatment outcomes is increased drug craving that occurs over the course of abstinence and subsequent relapse to drug use. This phenomenon, known as the incubation of drug craving, has been modeled extensively in rodent models of intravenous drug self-administration. The design of most intravenous self-administration studies examining the incubation effect precludes disentangling appetitive and consummatory behaviors as drug seeking (appetitive) and taking (consummatory) is simultaneous. Here, we employed a model of oral cocaine self-administration to interrogate the incubation of drug vs nondrug craving, where the route of administration is identical between reinforcers and appetitive and consummatory behaviors are dissociable. Oral self-administration of cocaine produced detectable levels of cocaine and its metabolite, benzoylecgonine, within the blood and brain, and tissue levels of both substrates correlated with cocaine consumption. When tested for seeking- (lever pressing) and taking-related (magazine head entries) behavior after 1 or 21 days of forced abstinence, we observed incubation of lever pressing among cocaine-administering mice and incubation of magazine entries among saccharin-administering mice. These behavioral changes were accompanied by reduced expression of the glial glutamate transporter GLT-1 within the nucleus accumbens (NAc) of cocaine self-administering mice, regardless of abstinence.

In contrast, under hypoxia, HIF-1 alpha subunit becomes stable and interacts with coactivators such as p300/CBP to modulate its transcriptional activity. Eventually, HIF-1 acts as a master regulator of numerous hypoxia-inducible genes under hypoxic conditions. The target genes of HIF-1 encode proteins that increase O2 delivery and mediate adaptive responses to O2 deprivation.

This study aims to investigate the role and regulatory mechanism of the PATZ1/USP22/HIF-1α axis in CHF pathogenesis. An in vitro CHF model was established using angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced H9c2 cardiomyocytes and an in vivo model was created by abdominal aortic constriction (AAC) in rats. Genetic manipulations were performed using shRNAs or overexpression plasmids. Cell viability and cardiac function were assessed by CCK-8, TUNEL staining, Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and hemodynamic measurements. Protein interactions, stability, and transcriptional regulation were analyzed via co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), ubiquitination assays, cycloheximide (CHX) chase assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation-qPCR (ChIP-qPCR), and dual-luciferase reporter assays. USP22 was significantly upregulated in human CHF datasets (GSE116250/GSE57345) and experimental models. USP22 knockdown reduced cardiomyocyte injury in vitro (increased viability, decreased apoptosis) and improved cardiac function in vivo (increased LVSP, decreased LVEDP, and reduced fibrosis). Mechanistically, USP22 bound to and stabilized HIF-1α protein by deubiquitination. HIF-1α overexpression reversed USP22 knockdown-mediated cardioprotection. Furthermore, PATZ1, which was upregulated in CHF, transcriptionally activated USP22 by binding to its promoter. PATZ1 silencing attenuated cardiac injury, while USP22 co-overexpression abrogated this protective effect by restoring HIF-1α levels.

This study sought to explore the mechanisms underlying MAP kinase-interacting serine/threonine-protein kinase 2 (MKNK2), a gene enriched in the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) signaling, in IS-related neurological injury. METHODS: Middle cerebral artery occlusion/reperfusion (MCAO/R) and oxygen-glucose deprivation/reoxygenation (OGD/R) models were used in vivo and in vitro. Rats were infected with lentiviral vectors harboring knockdown or overexpression of the target genes, followed by MCAO/R to conduct 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride, HE, Fluoro-Jade C, and TUNEL, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunohistochemistry, and neurological deficits assessment. The regulation of Krueppel-like factor 7 (KLF7) on MKNK2 was analyzed by ChIP and dual-luciferase assays. The effects of the KLF7/MKNK2/HIF-1 axis on the M1 or M2 polarization of rat microglia were demonstrated by the transfection of knockdown or overexpression plasmids into the cells. RESULTS: MCAO/R-treated rat brain tissues and OGD/R-treated rat microglia showed MKNK2 upregulation along with activation of the HIF-1 signaling, whereas KLF7 expression was downregulated. Knockdown of MKNK2 inhibited the HIF-1 signaling and M1 microglia polarization, whereas it promoted M2 polarization. KLF7 repressed the MKNK2 transcription, thereby achieving the same effect as the knockdown of MKNK2 in vitro, which was reversed by combined overexpression of MKNK2. Knockdown of MKNK2 or overexpression of KLF7 ameliorated MCAO/R-induced brain damage and neurological injury in rats.

As the global burden of OA continues to rise, novel therapeutic strategies are urgently needed. Kaempferide (KA), a flavonoid derived from traditional Chinese herbal medicine, is known for its anti-inflammatory properties. However, the effect of KA on the progression of OA has not been well investigated. This study aimed to explore the therapeutic potential of KA in an OA model and investigate the underlying mechanisms via transcriptomic sequencing. METHODS: An in vitro OA model was established using SW1353 cells treated with interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) and different concentrations of KA (30, 60, or 90 μmol/L) for 24 h. The anti-inflammatory effects of KA were assessed using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and Western blotting. In vivo , a papain-induced OA rat model was used to evaluate the therapeutic effects of KA through histological and behavioral analyses. Transcriptomic sequencing was performed to explore the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and related signaling pathways. Statistical analysis was conducted using one-way analysis of variance. RESULTS: KA significantly increased cell viability in the OA chondrocyte model and downregulated the expression of inflammatory cytokines and cartilage degradation markers, with the greatest reduction observed at 90 μmol/L. In vivo , KA treatment mitigated cartilage degradation and improved gait behavior in OA rats. Transcriptomic analysis revealed substantial modulation of DEGs, implicating the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF-1) signaling pathway as a key mechanism. Further blocking and rescue experiments revealed that KA regulated key molecules within the HIF-1 pathway, specifically interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) and hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α), confirming their critical roles in mediating the therapeutic effects of KA.

Allograft rejection remains a main hindrance for long-term graft survival. Cellular senescence (CS) contributes to graft injury, but the role of immune cell senescence in rejection remains unclear. METHODS: Microarray data from renal transplant biopsy cohorts and age-matched rat allograft models were integrated to characterize senescence phenotypes. Immune cell infiltration algorithms and histopathology were employed to recognize major senescent alloimmune subpopulation. Then, novel senescent infiltrating macrophages (SnIMs) were identified using cross-species single-cell transcriptomics and validated in rat models. Finally, the clinical values of SnIMs were evaluated in renal transplant datasets. RESULTS: CS gene sets were enriched in rejecting allografts, correlating with graft loss and pathological injury. Alloimmune responses amplified stress-induced senescence in rat allografts, with p21+ macrophages emerging as the important senescent immune subtype. SnIMs exhibited cell cycle arrest, upregulation of senescence-associated secretory phenotype, and conserved transcriptional signatures driven by NF-κB/Cebpb across species through single-cell analysis. These cells accumulated along pseudotime during rejection and interacted with effector T cells via CXCL chemokines. Clinically, SnIM infiltration predicted T cell-mediated rejection and correlated with Banff lesion grades and poor graft survival.

Macrophages, the most prevalent leucocyte found in nephrolithiasis, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of kidney stones. METHODS: Using oxalate (Ox) induction to simulate the hyperoxaluria microenvironment in vivo, fisetin was administered to human renal proximal tubular epithelial cells (HK-2 cells). The senescence of HK-2 cells was evaluated by detecting SA-β-gal staining, expression of senescence markers p16 and p53, and levels of senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) molecules. THP-1 cells were differentiated into macrophages (M0-MΦs) using PMA induction, and macrophages in different polarization states (M1-like phenotype, M2-like phenotype) were treated with the supernatant from HK-2 cell culture. siRNA gene knockdown technology was applied to evaluate the activity of the LXN/Rps3/p53 pathway during oxalate-induced senescence in HK-2 cells. A rat model of calcium oxalate crystal-induced kidney injury was established, and the rats were divided into following groups: PBS, oxalate, oxalate + fisetin, oxalate + transfection with LXN-knockdown adeno-associated virus (AAV-shLXN), and oxalate + fisetin + AAV-shLXN, Histological assessment was performed using HE staining and Von Kossa staining of kidney tissues. The expression levels of LXN, Rps3, p53, iNOS, and CD163 in renal tissues were evaluated by immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: The onset of RTEC senescence was increased after treatment with oxalate, and the increase in RTEC senescence was reduced by fisetin treatment. Interestingly, the changes in proinflammatory M1-like phenotype polarization induced by culture medium from HK-2 cells treated with Ox+/-fisetin were consistent with the proportion of senescent HK-2 cells cultured. Furthermore, reducing cellular LXN/Rps3/p53 signaling significantly decreased SASP factors in the culture medium and simultaneously abolished M1-like phenotype macrophage polarization. More importantly, silencing renal LXN reduced RTEC senescence and M1-like phenotype macrophage polarization and consequently decreased intrarenal CaOx crystal deposition in a rat kidney stone model.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Twenty-eight male Sprague Dawley rats were divided into four groups: Control, MI, MI + DMSO, and MI + Daidzein. MI was induced with ISO (85 mg/kg) subcutaneously twice with a 24-h intervals. Daidzein was administered intraperitoneally (10 mg/kg) daily for seven days post-MI. Serum troponin were measured 24 h after MI to confirm injury. Cardiac tissues were analyzed for total antioxidant status (TAS), total oxidant status (TOS), Neuregulin-1 (NRG-1), erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog 2 (ErbB2), and Protein Kinase B (Akt) levels using ELISA. Histopathological and immunohistochemical evaluations were conducted. TOS and oxidative stablity index (OSI) levels were significantly higher in the MI group compared to the Control (P < 0.05), but daidzein treatment significantly reduced these levels (P = 0.014, P = 0.036). NRG-1 and ErbB2 levels were decreased in the MI group compared to Control (P = 0.029, P = 0.001) but restored by daidzein (P = 0.026, P = 0.01). Immunohistochemistry showed increased NRG-1 and ErbB2 in cardiac tissue following daidzein treatment, and histopathology confirmed reduced inflammation, damage, and fibrosis (P < 0.05).

METHODS: Bioactive components of Huoshan Dendrobium Zengye Jiedu Formula (HDZJF) and RIOM-related targets were retrieved from public databases. Core therapeutic targets and pathways were systematically analyzed via protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, Gene Ontology (GO), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment. Molecular docking evaluated interactions between HDZJF components and key targets. A rat RIOM model validated HDZJF efficacy by assessing mucositis severity, inflammatory cytokines, and EGFR/PI3K/AKT pathway protein expression. RESULTS: A total of 102 bioactive components and 379 potential targets for RIOM were identified. GO and KEGG enrichment analyses suggest that HDZJF exerts therapeutic effects on RIOM by modulating processes such as angiogenesis, inflammation, and apoptosis through pathways like PI3K-AKT.

Anmeidan on hippocampal neuronal damage and synaptic microenvironment in sleep-deprived rats based on NRG1/ErbB4 signaling pathway].", "abstract": "This study aims to investigate the effect of Anmeidan on hippocampal neurons and synaptic microenvironments in sleep-deprived rats. Sixty SD rats were randomly divided into blank, model, Anmeidan, and melatonin groups, with 15 rats in one group. The study used the multi-platform method to prepare the sleep deprivation model. A dosage of 18.18 g·kg~(-1)·d~(-1) was administered to the Anmeidan group, a dosage of 100 mg·kg~(-1)·d~(-1) to the melatonin group, and pure water to the blank and model groups. All rats were administered by gavage for 4 weeks. The spontaneous activity of rats was assessed by using a behavioral analysis system. Hip-pocampal pyramidal neurons and Nissl bodies were observed by Nissl staining. Neuronal apoptosis was observed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP nick-end labeling(TUNEL) staining. The ultrastructure of synaptic was observed by transmission electron microscopy, and dendritic spine changes were observed by Golgi staining. The expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein(GFAP), γ-aminobutyric acid A(GABAA), glutamate receptor N1(GLUN1), postsynaptic density-95(PSD95), synaptophysin(SYP), brain-derived neurotrophic factor(BDNF), and nerve growth factor(NGF) were detected by immunofluorescence staining. The expression of neuregulin 1(NRG1), epidermal growth factor receptor(ErbB4), glutamate receptor A1(GLUA1), GLUN1, and glutamate receptor N2A(GLUN2A) were detected by Western blot. While compared with the blank group, the results showed that the model group had a significant decrease in the horizontal score, vertical score, modified times, ratio of the central region, a decline in the number of hippocampal pyramidal cells and Nissl bodies, and an increase in the apoptotic index. The expression of NRG1, ErbB4, GLUA1, GLUN1, and GLUN2A proteins was down-regulated, and the positive expression of GFAP~+/GABAA~+ and GFAP~+/GLUN1~+ was decreased. The fluorescence intensity of PSD95, SYP, BDNF, and NGF decreased, and the synaptic vesicle density was uneven. Synaptic interface curvature and postsynaptic density thickness reduced, and dendritic spines decreased. Compared with the model group, the Anmeidan group showed an increase in the horizontal score, the vertical score, the modified times, the central area path ratio, the pyra-midal cells and Nissl bodies, while the apoptotic index decreased. The expression of NRG1, ErbB4, GLUA1, GLUN1, and GLUN2A was up-regulated, and that of GFAP~+/GABAA~+ and GFAP~+/GLUN1~+ was increased. The fluorescence intensities of PSD95, SYP, and BDNF, NGF were increased, and synaptic damage was reduced.

{"id": "rno04064", "name": "NF-kappa B signaling pathway - Rattus norvegicus (rat)", "description": "Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) is the generic name of a family of transcription factors that function as dimers and regulate genes involved in immunity, inflammation and cell survival. There are several pathways leading to NF-kappa B-activation. The canonical pathway is induced by tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-1 (IL-1) or byproducts of bacterial and viral infections. This pathway relies on IKK- mediated IkappaB-alpha phosphorylation on Ser32 and 36, leading to its degradation, which allows the p50/p65 NF-kappa B dimer to enter the nucleus and activate gene transcription. Atypical pathways are IKK-independent and rely on phosphorylation of IkappaB-alpha on Tyr42 or on Ser residues in IkappaB-alpha PEST domain. The non-canonical pathway is triggered by particular members of the TNFR superfamily, such as lymphotoxin-beta (LT-beta) or BAFF. It involves NIK and IKK-alpha-mediated p100 phosphorylation and processing to p52, resulting in nuclear translocation of p52/RelB heterodimers.", "genes": ["100360982"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "41308877", "title": "Effects of Saikosaponin A on post-traumatic stress disorder-like behaviors, hippocampal monoaminergic neurotransmission, and the NF-κB inflammatory pathway in a rat model.", "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating psychiatric condition with limited effective treatments.

Behavioral assessments included open-field, elevated plus maze, freezing behavior test, and forced swim tests.

with high rates of disability and mortality. Rapid reperfusion is critical for treating IS, yet paradoxically, it induces reperfusion injury. Astrocytes, the most abundant glial cells in the CNS, are increasingly recognized for their role in neuroinflammation and tissue repair post-ischemia. Silent information regulator 2 homolog 1 (SIRT1), a NAD + -dependent deacetylase, has emerged as a key regulator of cell survival, metabolism, and neuroprotection. Melatonin, an endogenous hormone with potent anti-inflammatory properties, has demonstrated the ability to mitigate neuroinflammatory processes, including the modulation of microglial activation through upregulation of the expression of SIRT1. However, the role of melatonin in the activation of inflammation in astrocytes after ischemic stroke remains unclear. This study investigates the role of melatonin in modulating astrocyte inflammatory activation following ischemic stroke and explores the potential involvement of SIRT1. Using rat models of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion and reperfusion (tMCAO/R) and in vitro oxygen-glucose deprivation/reperfusion (OGD/R) injury in primary astrocytes, we demonstrate that melatonin treatment significantly reduces inflammation by enhancing SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of NF-κB, a critical regulator of inflammatory responses.

Posterior circulation ischemia vertigo (PCIV) frequently presents with vestibular dysfunction in patients suffering from posterior circulation stroke. The conventional approaches often fail to address PCIV's complex pathophysiology, which involves neuroimmune dysregulation, hemodynamic abnormalities, and gut-brain axis disruption. Banxia Baizhu Tianma Decoction (BBTD), a traditional Chinese medicine, is employed in treating PCIV and vasogenic vertigo, but the mechanisms underlying its efficacy require further elucidation. PURPOSE: This study examines the therapeutic mechanisms and efficacy of BBTD for PCIV, particularly focusing on its impacts on neuroinflammation, gut microbiota communities, and gut barrier using a rat model of PCIV. METHODS: The chemical and bioactive constituents of BBTD were profiled using ULPLC-Q Exactive-Orbitrap-MS. The PCIV model was employed and treated with BBTD for 7 days. Neurological score was measured with balance beam test; cerebellar pathology was assessed by H&E and Nissl staining. The TTC staining was used to measure cerebral infarct volume. The levels of IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α in serum and cerebellar tissue was analyzed by ELISA. Its mechanisms were investigated by 16S rRNA sequencing, antibiotic antagonistic and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) experiments. Significant alterations in gut microbiota and their detailed mechanisms were identified. Intestinal barrier integrity was assessed by AB-PAS staining, tight junction proteins (MUC2, occludin, claudin-1, ZO-1), and colonic inflammatory cytokine levels. The levels of short-chain fatty acids in the cecal contents and cerebellar tissues of our experimental rats using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). RESULTS: Our findings demonstrated that BBTD significantly improved neurological function, ameliorates cerebral ischemia, and alleviated neuroinflammation in rats. Moreover, BBTD significantly modulated the diversity and composition of the gut microbiota, elevating Lactobacillus and Akkermansia, while reducing Clostridiales and Ruminococcaceae. The further antibiotic depletion and FMT experiments confirmed that gut microbiota was essential for BBTD-induced neuroinflammation and gut barrier protection in PCIV. BBTD ameliorated intestinal damage by enhancing acidic mucins and tight junction protein expression. BBTD treatment markedly increased the concentrations of propionic acid in intestinal fecal content and cerebellar tissue. Mechanistically, BBTD ameliorates ischemia-induced neuroinflammation and neuronal injury by modulating the TLR4-NF-κB-MyD88 pathway via the gut-brain axis. CONCLUSION: BBTD ameliorates PCIV through gut-brain axis modulation, restoring gut barrier-microbiota balance and suppressing TLR4-NF-κB-MyD88 signaling. BBTD treatment and FMT may serve as an effective therapeutic strategy for mitigating posterior circulation ischemia progression.", "authors": "Huang F; Zhang L; Cheng S; Zhang Z; Xiang Q; Xiao Z", "fulltext_url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2025.157539", "keywords": "NF-kappa B signaling pathway[MeSH Terms] AND rat[MeSH Terms]", "llm_relevance_assessment": {"relevance_score": 8, "relevance_level": "High", "species_check": "The pathway is in Rattus norvegicus (rat), and the study uses a rat model of posterior circulation ischemia, ensuring species consistency.", "evidence_summary": ["Mechanistically, BBTD ameliorates ischemia-induced neuroinflammation and neuronal injury by modulating the TLR4-NF-κB-MyD88 pathway via the gut-brain axis.", "The levels of IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α in serum and cerebellar tissue was analyzed by ELISA."], "reasoning": "The article directly investigates the TLR4-NF-κB-MyD88 pathway in a rat model, which is a key component of the NF-kappa B signaling pathway.

Amygdalin has antitussive and asthmatic properties and may play a role in intervening in PF. This study was to investigate the effects of amygdalin on bleomycin-induced PF in rats by integrating pharmacodynamics, transcriptomics, and untargeted metabolomics. The experimental findings indicated that the 20 mg/kg amygdalin group exhibited a significant reduction in inflammatory and fibrotic markers, thereby demonstrating the most pronounced anti-PF effect. Following amygdalin treatment, levels of 117 mRNA and 21 metabolites, including linoleic acid, citrulline and sphingosine 1-phosphate, were significantly restored in PF rats. These mRNAs are enriched in pathways such as neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions, phospholipase D signaling, and linoleic acid metabolism, and these metabolites are closely related to linoleic acid metabolism, arginine biosynthesis, and sphingolipid metabolism. Combined transcriptomic and untargeted metabolomic analyses revealed that amygdalin 's mechanism of action is closely linked to five pathways, including neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions, the phospholipase D signaling pathway and linoleic acid metabolism. These pathways may be the key pathways for the anti-PF of amygdalin. Furthermore, 3 key metabolites and 11 key genes in the key pathway may be closely related to the anti-PF mechanism of amygdalin and are key biomarkers.

Recent evidence demonstrates an additional role in regulating synaptic homeostasis in response to inactivity, where dendritic mTORC1 serves to modulate presynaptic function via retrograde signaling. Presently, it is unclear whether LTP and homeostatic plasticity use a common route to mTORC1-dependent signaling or whether each engage mTORC1 through distinct pathways. Here, we report a unique signaling pathway that specifically couples homeostatic signaling to postsynaptic mTORC1 after loss of excitatory synaptic input. We find that AMPAR blockade, but not LTP-inducing stimulation, induces phospholipase D (PLD)-dependent synthesis of the lipid second messenger phosphatidic acid (PA) in rat cultured hippocampal neurons of either sex. Pharmacological blockade of PLD1/2 or pharmacogenetic disruption of PA interactions with mTOR eliminates mTORC1 signaling and presynaptic compensation driven by AMPAR blockade, but does not alter mTORC1 activation or functional changes during chemical LTP (cLTP). Overexpression of PLD1, but not PLD2, recapitulates both functional synaptic changes as well as signature cellular adaptations associated with homeostatic plasticity. Finally, transient application of exogenous PA is sufficient to drive rapid presynaptic compensation requiring mTORC1-dependent translation of BDNF in the postsynaptic compartment. These results thus define a unique homeostatic signaling pathway coupling mTORC1 activation to changes in excitatory synaptic drive. Our results further imply that more than one canonical mTORC1 activation pathway may be relevant for the design of novel therapeutic approaches against neurodevelopmental disorders associated with mTORC1 dysregulation.<b>SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT</b> Homeostatic and Hebbian forms of synaptic plasticity are thought to play complementary roles in regulating neural circuit function, but we know little about how these forms of plasticity are distinguished at the single neuron level.

METHODS: Renal I/RI was induced by occluding the kidney arteries for 45 min, then reperfusion for 24 h. Four similar cycles of left femoral artery ischemia (2 min)/reperfusion (3 min) before the onset of kidney ischemia were performed to create RIPreC. Animals were randomly divided into three groups: sham, I/R, and RIPreC + I/R. Following the reperfusion phase, urine and blood samples were taken, and the kidney was removed for functional, molecular, and histological examination. RESULTS: When compared to sham rats, renal IRI resulted in decreased creatinine clearance and increased sodium fractional excretion, lower antioxidant enzyme activities, higher malondialdehyde content and higher nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), transforming growth factor-betta (TGF-β), and Apelin expression levels, and histologically damaged kidney tissue.

pharmacology and in vivo experimental validation. METHODS: The chemical compounds of TRQ were retrieved based on published data, with targets retrieved from PubChem, Therapeutic Target Database and DrugBank. Network visualization and analysis were performed using Cytoscape, with protein-protein interaction networks derived from the STRING database. Enrichment analysis was performed using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes Genomes pathway and Gene Ontology analysis. In in vivo experiments, the middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model was used. Infarct volume was determined by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium hydrochloride staining and protein expressions were analyzed by Western blot. Molecular docking was performed to predict ligand-receptor interactions. RESULTS: We screened 81 chemical compounds in TRQ and retrieved their therapeutic targets. Of the targets, 116 were therapeutic targets for stroke. The enrichment analysis showed that the apelin signaling pathway was a key pathway for ischemic stroke. Furthermore, in in vivo experiment we found that administering with intraperitoneal injection of 2.5 mL/kg TRQ every 6 h could significantly reduce the infarct volume of MCAO rats (P<0.05). In addition, protein levels of the apelin receptor (APJ)/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) pathway were increased by TRQ (P<0.05).

Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 85% of lung cancer and represents a heterogeneous group of cancers, consisting mainly of squamous cell (SCC), adeno (AC) and large-cell carcinoma. Molecular mechanisms altered in NSCLC include activation of oncogenes, such as K-RAS, EGFR and EML4-ALK, and inactivation of tumorsuppressor genes, such as p53, p16INK4a, RAR-beta, and RASSF1. Point mutations within the K-RAS gene inactivate GTPase activity and the p21-RAS protein continuously transmits growth signals to the nucleus. Mutations or overexpression of EGFR leads to a proliferative advantage. EML4-ALK fusion leads to constitutive ALK activation, which causes cell proliferation, invasion, and inhibition of apoptosis. Inactivating mutation of p53 can lead to more rapid proliferation and reduced apoptosis. The protein encoded by the p16INK4a inhibits formation of CDK-cyclin-D complexes by competitive binding of CDK4 and CDK6. Loss of p16INK4a expression is a common feature of NSCLC. RAR-beta is a nuclear receptor that bears vitamin-A-dependent transcriptional activity.

METHODS: Bioinformatics, immunohistochemistry (IHC), immunofluorescence (IF), western blot (WB), real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (qPCR), rat primary myocardial fibroblasts (rCFs) culture, doxorubicin (DOX) induced mouse dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) model, and in vivo adeno-associated virus (AAV) infection were used to explore the role of SOCS2 in DCM. RESULTS: Bioinformatics analysis showed that SOCS2 was positively correlated with fibrosis related factors. SOCS2 was significantly upregulated in patients and mice with DCM. In vivo experiments showed that targeted inhibition of cardiac SOCS2 could improve mouse cardiac function and alleviate myocardial fibrosis. Further research demonstrated that SOCS2 promoted the transformation of myofibroblasts. Knockdown of SOCS2 reduced the nuclear localization of β-catenin, which inhibited the fibrogenic effect of Wnt/β-catenin pathway. In addition, bioinformatics analysis suggested that lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1 (LEF1) was significantly positively correlated with SOCS2. Finally, dual luciferase assays demonstrated that LEF1 could bind to the promoter region of SOCS2, thereby mediating its transcriptional activation. CONCLUSION: SOCS2 could activate the Wnt/β-catenin by regulating the nuclear translocation of β-catenin, which induces the transcriptional activation of SOCS2.

"PURPOSE: Doxorubicin is an important cancer chemotherapeutic agent with severe cardiotoxic effects that eventually lead to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Calsyntenin-1(CLSTN1) plays a critical role in the nervous system, but its relevance in cardiovascular diseases is unknown. We investigated the significance of CLSTN1 in doxorubicin-induced DCM. METHODS: CLSTN1 expression in doxorubicin-induced DCM rats and H9c2 cells was determined using western blotting. To further explore the functions of CLSTN1, a cardiac-specific CLSTN1 overexpression rat model was constructed. The rats were subjected to analysis using echocardiographic, hemodynamic, and electrocardiographic parameters. Potential downstream molecules in CLSTN1 overexpression heart tissue were investigated using proteomics and western blotting. Finally, a knockdown of CLSTN1 was constructed to investigate the rescue function on doxorubicin-induced cell toxicity. RESULTS: CLSTN1 protein expression increased drastically in doxorubicin-induced DCM rats and H9c2 cells. Under doxorubicin treatment, CLSTN1 protein-specific overexpression in the heart muscle promoted cardiac chamber enlargement and heart failure, while the knockdown of CLSTN1 reduced doxorubicin-induced cardiomyocyte toxicity in vitro. At the mechanistic level, overexpression of CLSTN1 downregulated SERCA2 expression and increased the phosphorylation levels of PI3K-Akt and CaMK2.

{"id": "rno04724", "name": "Glutamatergic synapse - Rattus norvegicus (rat)", "description": "Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system(CNS). Glutamate is packaged into synaptic vesicles in the presynaptic terminal. Once released into the synaptic cleft, glutamate acts on postsynaptic ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs) to mediate fast excitatory synaptic transmission. Glutamate can also act on metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) and exert a variety of modulatory effects through their coupling to G proteins and the subsequent recruitment of second messenger systems. Presynaptically localized Group II and Group III mGluRs are thought to represent the classical inhibitory autoreceptor mechanism that suppresses excess glutamate release. After its action on these receptors, glutamate can be removed from the synaptic cleft by EAATs located either on the presynaptic terminal, neighboring glial cells, or the postsynaptic neuron. In glia, glutamate is converted to glutamine, which is then transported back to the presynaptic terminal and converted back to glutamate.", "genes": ["114117"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "40915475", "title": "Levofloxacin-induced seizure susceptibility involves both enhanced glutamatergic and impaired GABAergic synaptic function.", "abstract": "Levofloxacin (LVFX)-associated seizures are thought to arise from disrupted excitatory-inhibitory balance, but the underlying synaptic mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigated how LVFX alters both glutamatergic and GABAergic transmission to promote neuronal hyperexcitability. We combined in vitro and in vivo approaches using primary cortical neurons treated with LVFX and adult rats administered LVFX. Electrophysiological recordings assessed AMPA receptor (AMPAR)-mediated miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) and GABAergic miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs). Molecular analyses examined vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (VGluT1) and vesicular GABA transporter (VGAT) expression, along with AMPAR subunit GluA1 trafficking dynamics. Seizure susceptibility was evaluated using magnesium-free conditions in vitro and pentylenetetrazol challenge in vivo. LVFX treatment significantly increased mEPSC frequency and amplitude while decreasing mIPSC frequency, indicating enhanced excitatory and suppressed inhibitory synaptic transmission. These changes were accompanied by upregulated VGluT1 and downregulated VGAT protein expression. The drug specifically altered GluA1 trafficking by decreasing internalization and promoting recycling to the plasma membrane. These synaptic modifications resulted in heightened seizure susceptibility, with LVFX-treated neurons showing earlier epileptiform discharges and pretreated animals exhibiting significantly reduced seizure latency.

Proper development of these specialized cellular junctions is important for normal brain functionality. Synaptic adhesion G protein-coupled receptors (aGPCRs) have been identified as regulators of synapse development and function. While two members of the Brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor (BAI/ADGRB) subfamily of synaptic aGPCRs, BAI1/ADGRB1 and BAI3/ADGRB3, have been found to mediate synapse and spine formation, BAI2/ADGRB2 function remains uncharacterized at the synapse. Here, we show that endogenous ADGRB2 is expressed throughout the nervous system with prominent expression in synapse dense regions of the hippocampus. In dissociated hippocampal cultures, ADGRB2 is highly enriched at large postsynaptic sites, defined by the size of the postsynaptic scaffold PSD95. Loss of ADGRB2 negatively impacts glutamatergic synapses across development in dissociated hippocampal cultures. In contrast, GABAergic synapse density is unchanged. Furthermore, ADGRB2 deficient neurons have significant alterations in spine morphology with decreased density of mature PSD95-containing mushroom-shaped spines compared with wild-type neurons. Interestingly, no major alterations in dendritic complexity were observed in ADGRB2 deficient neurons, in contrast to previous results for the other BAIs/ADGRBs.

Vagal afferent neurons release glutamate via functionally distinct action potential-dependent (evoked) and -independent (spontaneous) release pathways. Current models remain conflicted regarding whether synapses maintain physically and functionally separate vesicle pools underlying each release pathway or if they are unified via a common pool of vesicles. Most evidence has been derived from neurons in the CNS, so it remains unclear whether there are shared or distinct vesicle pools for both forms of release within terminals of peripheral sensory neurons. Here we aimed to determine the functional organization of vesicles used for evoked versus spontaneous glutamate release from vagal afferent terminals. We performed whole-cell patch-clamp electrophysiology on NTS neurons within acute rat brainstem slices and measured glutamatergic EPSCs combined with pharmacological use-dependent inhibition of presynaptic vesicle filling or postsynaptic NMDA receptor blockade. Despite the differences in functional characteristics between evoked and spontaneous release, we found that a common population of presynaptic vagal afferent vesicles and postsynaptic glutamate receptors were used for both action potential-evoked and activity-independent spontaneous transmission pathways. We conclude that at vagal afferent terminals, vesicle release pathways pull from a common vesicle pool while exhibiting functionally distinct controls and points of regulation. This vesicle handling strategy may allow for shared resources while preserving distinct information types encoded by spontaneous and evoked release that are important for transmission of viscerosensory information. KEY POINTS: Evoked and spontaneous glutamate release from vagal afferent neurons onto the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) appear to be functionally different processes with distinct mechanisms controlling their release. Preventing spontaneously released vesicles from refilling with glutamate reveals that spontaneous and evoked release draw from a common pool of synaptic vesicles in vagal afferent terminals.

Emerging therapies, such as mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes and exercise training, have shown promise, but their individual efficacy is insufficient. The synergistic effects of menstrual blood-derived mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes (MenSCs-Exo) and weight-supported treadmill training (WSTT) in SCI repair remain unclear. This study investigated their combined therapeutic potential and underlying mechanisms in SCI rats. METHODS: A T10 spinal cord hemisection model was conducted in adult male Sprague-Dawley rats, which were randomized into five groups: Sham, SCI, Exo (200 µg MenSCs-Exo via tail vein injection every 48 h for 4 doses), TT (WSTT starting on day 3 post-SCI), and Exo + TT. Motor function was evaluated using the Basso, Beattie, and Bresnahan (BBB) scale and CatWalk XT<sup>®</sup> gait analysis. Histological assessments included hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, Masson's trichrome staining, immunofluorescence for β-tubulin III (Tuj1) and myelin basic protein (MBP), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Western blot analyzed fibrosis-related proteins (COL1, COL3, α-SMA) and PI3K/AKT pathway activation (p-AKT, PI3K, β-catenin, LEF1). RESULTS: Combined Exo + TT significantly improved motor function compared to monotherapies. BBB scores in the Exo + TT group were higher than SCI controls from day 7, with marked differences at 4 weeks (P < 0.05). CatWalk analysis revealed enhanced hindlimb coordination, reduced dragging, and improved paw print parameters in Exo + TT rats. Histologically, Exo + TT reduced spinal cord cavitation, inflammation, and fibrosis (P < 0.01 vs. SCI), while promoting axonal (Tuj1) and myelin (MBP) regeneration with ordered structure. TEM showed preserved myelin lamellae and reduced axonal degeneration. Western blot confirmed decreased COL1, COL3, and α-SMA expression, along with upregulated p-Akt, PI3K, β-catenin, and LEF1 in Exo + TT rats (P < 0.01).

{"id": "rno05020", "name": "Prion disease - Rattus norvegicus (rat)", "description": "Prion diseases, also termed transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs), are a group of fatal neurodegenerative diseases that affect humans and a number of other animal species. The etiology of these diseases is thought to be associated with the conversion of a normal protein, PrPC, into an infectious, pathogenic form, PrPSc. The conversion is induced by prion infections (for example, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD), iatrogenic CJD, Kuru), mutations (familial CJD, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome, fatal familial insomnia (FFI)) or unknown factors (sporadic CJD (sCJD)), and is thought to occur after PrPC has reached the plasma membrane or is re-internalized for degradation. The PrPSc form shows greater protease resistance than PrPC and accumulates in affected individuals, often in the form of extracellular plaques. Pathways that may lead to neuronal death comprise oxidative stress, regulated activation of complement, ubiquitin-proteasome and endosomal-lysosomal systems, synaptic alterations and dendritic atrophy, corticosteroid response, and endoplasmic reticulum stress. In addition, the conformational transition could lead to the lost of a beneficial activity of the natively folded protein, PrPC.", "genes": ["100188937"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "40434970", "title": "Proliferative arrest induces neuronal differentiation and innate immune responses in normal and Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease agent (CJ) infected rat septal neurons.", "abstract": "Rat post-mitotic septal neurons, engineered to reversibly proliferate and arrest under physiological conditions, can be maintained for weeks without cytotoxic effects. Nine representative independent cDNA libraries were made to evaluate global arrest-induced neural differentiation and innate immune responses, e.g., upregulated interferon (β-IFN) RNA, that were previously identified in normal uninfected and Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease agent (CJ) infected septal neurons. This reversible cell model encompassed a non-productive latent (CJ-) and a highly infectious (CJ + , 10 logs/gm) state. Arrest of normal uninfected neurons upregulated a plethora of anti-proliferative transcripts and known neuronal differentiation transcripts (e.g., Neuregulin-1, GDF6 and Prnp). As expected, many activated IFN innate immune genes were simultaneously upregulated (e.g., OAS1, ISG20, CD80, cytokines, chemokines and complement) along with clusterin (CLU) that binds misfolded proteins. Arrest of latently infected CJ- cells induced even more profound global transcript differences. CJ+ cells markedly downregulated the anti-proliferative controls seen in arrested normal cells. CJ+ infection also suppressed neuronal differentiation transcripts, including Prnp which is essential for CJ infection. In contrast, IFN and cytokine/chemokine pathways were strongly upregulated. Analysis of the 342 CJ+ unique transcripts revealed additional innate immune and anti-viral-linked transcripts, e.g., Il17, ISG15, and RSAD2 (viperin). These data show: 1) innate immune transcripts are produced by normal neurons during differentiation; 2) CJ infection enhances and expands anti-viral responses; 3) non-productive latent infection can epigenetically imprint many proliferative pathways to thwart complete arrest. This rare cell model of latent infection is fundamental for interrogating triggers of late onset disease that are also relevant for Alzheimer's Disease. Peripheral human blood and intestinal myeloid cells that are latently infected may also be conditionally stimulated in vitro to produce CJ+ linked diagnostic transcripts.", "authors": "Pagano N; Aguilar Perez G; Garcia-Milian R; Manuelidis L", "fulltext_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12118874/", "keywords": "Prion disease[MeSH Terms] AND rat[MeSH Terms]", "llm_relevance_assessment": {"relevance_score": 8, "relevance_level": "High", "species_check": "The pathway is for Rattus norvegicus (rat), and the study uses rat septal neurons, so the species match directly.", "evidence_summary": "Arrest of normal uninfected neurons upregulated ...

lower prion protein (PrP) expression in the brain. Trials of such therapies are likely to rely on quantification of PrP in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) as a pharmacodynamic biomarker and possibly as a trial endpoint. Studies using PrP ELISA kits have shown that CSF PrP is lowered in the symptomatic phase of disease, a potential confounder for reading out the effect of PrP-lowering drugs in symptomatic patients. Because misfolding or proteolytic cleavage could potentially render PrP invisible to ELISA even if its concentration were constant or increasing in disease, we sought to establish an orthogonal method for CSF PrP quantification. We developed a multi-species targeted mass spectrometry method based on multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) of nine PrP tryptic peptides quantified relative to an isotopically labeled recombinant protein standard for human samples, or isotopically labeled synthetic peptides for nonhuman species. Analytical validation experiments showed process replicate coefficients of variation below 15%, good dilution linearity and recovery, and suitable performance for both CSF and brain homogenate and across humans as well as preclinical species of interest. In <i>n</i> = 55 CSF samples from individuals referred to prion surveillance centers with rapidly progressive dementia, all six human PrP peptides, spanning the N- and C-terminal domains of PrP, were uniformly reduced in prion disease cases compared with individuals with nonprion diagnoses. Thus, lowered CSF PrP concentration in prion disease is a genuine result of the disease process and not an artifact of ELISA-based measurement. As a result, dose-finding studies for PrP lowering drugs may need to be conducted in presymptomatic at-risk individuals rather than in symptomatic patients.

Constitutively active CaM kinase II phosphorylates AMPA receptors, resulting in potentiation of the ionic conductance of AMPA receptors. Early-phase LTP (E-LTP) expression is due, in part, to this phosphorylation of the AMPA receptor. It is hypothesized that postsynaptic Ca2+ increases generated through NMDA receptors activate several signal transduction pathways including the Erk/MAP kinase and cAMP regulatory pathways. The convergence of these pathways at the level of the CREB/CRE transcriptional pathway may increase expression of a family of genes required for late-phase LTP (L-LTP).", "genes": ["114486"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "41249054", "title": "Transient Photoactivation of Rac1 Induces Persistent Structural LTP Independent of CaMKII in Hippocampal Dendritic Spines.", "abstract": "Structural changes in dendritic spines underlie long-term potentiation (LTP).

S-palmitoylation, a reversible post-translational lipid modification, modulates synaptic protein function by influencing protein conformation, localization, trafficking, and molecular interactions. Despite its known significance in neuronal function, the temporal and protein-specific dynamics of S-palmitoylation during synaptic plasticity remain poorly understood. METHODOLOGY & PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using electrophysiological methods, molecular biology, proteomics, and imaging across various models (neuronal cultures, hippocampal slices, and synaptoneurosomes), we investigated S-palmitoylation during synaptic activity. Induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) resulted in protein-specific palmitoylation changes without altering global levels. In hippocampal slices, synaptophysin and PSD95 displayed distinct temporal patterns of palmitoylation, influenced by LTP. Deacylation experiments using N-(tert-butyl)hydroxylamine (NtBuHA) demonstrated that protein S-palmitoylation is crucial for organizing neuronal spiking and enabling LTP, particularly in the stratum radiatum. Mass spectrometry of synaptoneurosomes revealed a palmitoylome including over 700 proteins, with stimulation-induced predominant depalmitoylation. Differentially palmitoylated proteins were associated with synaptic vesicle cycling, cytoskeletal dynamics, and neurotransmitter release. What is interesting is that synaptoneurosomes contained active palmitoylation machinery, supporting rapid, target-specific responses to NMDA receptor activation. CONCLUSIONS: Temporal and protein-specific S-palmitoylation emerges as a vital mechanism for synaptic plasticity, contributing to neuronal network function and memory formation.

The primary cilium is an important center for transduction of the Hedgehog signal in vertebrates. In Hh's absence, the Ptch receptor localizes to the cilium, where it inhibits Smo activation. Gli proteins are phosphorylated by PKA, CKI and GSK3B and partially degraded into truncated Gli repressor form (GliR) that suppresses Hh target gene transcription in the nucleus. In Hh's presence, Ptch disappears from the cilium, and activated Smo contributes to the translocation of the protein complex Gli, Sufu, Kif7 to ciliary tip, where Gli dissociates from the negative regulator Sufu.

However, the effects of developmental exposure to NP on this pool remain unclear. Thus, our aim was to clarify the impacts of developmental exposure to NP on this pool and to explore the potential mechanisms. Animal models of developmental exposure to NP were created by treating Wistar rats with NP during pregnancy and lactation. Our data showed that developmental exposure to NP decreased Sox2-and Ki67-positive cells in the SGZ of offspring. Inhibited activation of Shh signaling and decreased levels of its downstream mediators, E2F1 and cyclins, were also observed in pups developmentally exposed to NP. Moreover, we established the in vitro model in the NE-4C cells, a neural precursor cell line, to further investigate the effect of NP exposure on NPCs and the underlying mechanisms. Purmorphamine, a small purine-derived hedgehog agonist, was used to specifically modulate the Shh signaling. Consistent with the in vivo results, exposure to NP reduced cell proliferation by inhibiting the Shh signaling in NE-4C cells, and purmorphamine alleviated this reduction in cell proliferation by restoring this signaling. Altogether, our findings support the idea that developmental exposure to NP leads to inhibition of the NPC proliferation and the NPC pool depletion in the SGZ located in the dentate gyrus.

{"id": "rno04114", "name": "Oocyte meiosis - Rattus norvegicus (rat)", "description": "During meiosis, a single round of DNA replication is followed by two rounds of chromosome segregation, called meiosis I and meiosis II. At meiosis I, homologous chromosomes recombine and then segregate to opposite poles, while the sister chromatids segregate from each other at meoisis II. In vertebrates, immature oocytes are arrested at the PI (prophase of meiosis I). The resumption of meiosis is stimulated by progesterone, which carries the oocyte through two consecutive M-phases (MI and MII) to a second arrest at MII. The key activity driving meiotic progression is the MPF (maturation-promoting factor), a heterodimer of CDC2 (cell division cycle 2 kinase) and cyclin B. In PI-arrested oocytes, MPF is initially inactive and is activated by the dual-specificity CDC25C phosphatase as the result of new synthesis of Mos induced by progesterone. MPF activation mediates the transition from the PI arrest to MI. The subsequent decrease in MPF levels, required to exit from MI into interkinesis, is induced by a negative feedback loop, where CDC2 brings about the activation of the APC (anaphase-promoting complex), which mediates destruction of cyclin B. Re-activation of MPF for MII requires re-accumulation of high levels of cyclin B as well as the inactivation of the APC by newly synthesized Emi2 and other components of the CSF (cytostatic factor), such as cyclin E or high levels of Mos. CSF antagonizes the ubiquitin ligase activity of the APC, preventing cyclin B destruction and meiotic exit until fertilization occurs. Fertilization triggers a transient increase in cytosolic free Ca2+, which leads to CSF inactivation and cyclin B destruction through the APC. Then eggs are released from MII into the first embryonic cell cycle.", "genes": ["100360936"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "35596034", "title": "Prdm9 deficiency of rat oocytes causes synapsis among non-homologous chromosomes and aneuploidy.", "abstract": "Aneuploidy (abnormal chromosome number) accompanies reduced ovarian function in humans and mice, but the reasons behind this concomitance remain underexplored. Some variants in the human gene encoding histone-3-lysine-4,36-trimethyltransferase PRDM9 are associated with aneuploidy, and other variants with ovarian function reduced by premature ovarian failure (POF), but no link between POF and aneuploidy has been revealed. SHR/OlaIpcv rat females lacking PRDM9 manifest POF-a reduced follicle number, litter size, and reproductive age. Here, we explored this model to test how POF relates to oocyte euploidy. The mutant rat females displayed increased oocyte aneuploidy and embryonic death of their offspring compared to controls. Because rat PRDM9 positions meiotic DNA breaks, we investigated the repair of these breaks. Fertile control rodents carry pachytene oocytes with synapsed homologous chromosomes and repaired breaks, while sterile Prdm9-deficient mice carry pachytene-like oocytes with many persisting breaks and asynapsed chromosomes. However, most PRDM9-lacking rat oocytes displayed a few persisting breaks and non-homologous synapsis (NHS). HORMAD2 protein serves as a barrier to sister-chromatid repair and a signal for the synapsis and DNA repair checkpoints. NHS but not asynapsis was associated with HORMAD2 levels similar to the levels on rat pachytene chromosomes with homologous synapsis. NHS was accompanied by crossing-over decreased below the minimum that is essential for euploidy. We argue that the increased mutant rat aneuploidy is due to NHS, which allows some oocytes to pass meiotic checkpoints without one crossing-over per chromosomal pair, leading to segregation errors, and thereby NHS links POF to aneuploidy.", "authors": "Gasic S; Mihola O; Trachtulec Z", "fulltext_url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s00335-022-09954-z", "keywords": "Oocyte meiosis[MeSH Terms] AND rat[MeSH Terms]", "llm_relevance_assessment": {"relevance_score": 9, "relevance_level": "High", "species_check": "The pathway is in Rattus norvegicus (rat), and the article also uses a rat model (SHR/OlaIpcv), making the species match exact.", "evidence_summary": "The mutant rat females displayed increased oocyte aneuploidy...

For this purpose, diplotene-arrested cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs) were collected from rat ovary. The COCs and denuded oocytes were exposed to various concentrations of cilostamide (0.0, 2.5, 5.0 and 10 μM) and rolipram (0, 10, 50 and 100 μM) for various times (0, 3, 5, 7, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22 and 24 h). Cilostamide inhibited spontaneous meiotic resumption in a concentration- and time-dependent manner in COCs and denuded oocytes. Although rolipram showed inhibition of spontaneous meiotic resumption up to some extent, cilostamide was more potent to prevent spontaneous meiotic resumption in both COCs and denuded oocytes. Cilostamide significantly reduced PDE 3A expression, increased cAMP level and prevented spontaneous meiotic resumption in COCs and denuded oocytes. Although rolipram inhibited PDE 4D expression in cumulus cells, increased cAMP level but was not sufficient to prevent spontaneous meiotic resumption. We conclude that both drugs prevent spontaneous resumption from diplotene-arrest through PDE 3A/PDE 4D-cAMP mediated pathway.

Fully grown oocytes can also mature spontaneously, upon their release from the ovarian follicle. However, growing oocytes fail to resume meiosis <i>in vitro</i> and the mechanism underlying their meiotic incompetence is unknown. It is commonly accepted that a drop in intraoocyte cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) resulting in the elevated activity of the oocyte-specific PDE3A leads to a decrease in cAMP content, essential for reinitiation of meiosis. We explored the regulation of these cyclic nucleotides and their degrading PDE3A in growing oocytes. Our research addressed the LH-induced rather than spontaneous oocyte maturation. We examined 16-21 as compared to 25-day-old, PMSG-primed rats, treated with the LH analog, hCG. The effect of LH was also examined <i>ex vivo</i>, in isolated ovarian follicles. We found that hCG failed to induce oocyte maturation and ovulation in the younger animals and that ovulation-associated genes were not upregulated in response to this gonadotropin. Furthemore, the drop of intraoocyte cGMP and cAMP observed in fully grown oocytes upon exposure of the ovary to LH, was not detected in growing oocytes.

Luteinizing hormone (LH) then releases meiotic arrest by lowering cGMP in the granulosa cells. The LH-induced reduction of cGMP is caused in part by a decrease in guanylyl cyclase activity, but the observation that the cGMP phosphodiesterase PDE5 is phosphorylated during LH signaling suggests that an increase in PDE5 activity could also contribute. To investigate this idea, we measured cGMP-hydrolytic activity in rat ovarian follicles. Basal activity was due primarily to PDE1A and PDE5, and LH increased PDE5 activity. The increase in PDE5 activity was accompanied by phosphorylation of PDE5 at serine 92, a protein kinase A/G consensus site. Both the phosphorylation and the increase in activity were promoted by elevating cAMP and opposed by inhibiting protein kinase A, supporting the hypothesis that LH activates PDE5 by stimulating its phosphorylation by protein kinase A. Inhibition of PDE5 activity partially suppressed LH-induced meiotic resumption as indicated by nuclear envelope breakdown, but inhibition of both PDE5 and PDE1 activities was needed to completely inhibit this response.

CRC arises from the colorectal epithelium as a result of the accumulation of genetic alterations in defined oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes (TSG).

The first, known as chromosomal instability (CIN), results from a series of genetic changes that involve the activation of oncogenes such as K-ras and inactivation of TSG such as p53, DCC/Smad4, and APC. The second, known as microsatellite instability (MSI), results from inactivation of the DNA mismatch repair genes MLH1 and/or MSH2 by hypermethylation of their promoter, and secondary mutation of genes with coding microsatellites, such as transforming growth factor receptor II (TGF-RII) and BAX.

remodeling of the immune cell niche.", "abstract": "A previously reported clinical trial in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) patients treated with erlotinib plus sulindac (ERL + SUL) highlighted immune response/interferon-γ signaling as a key pathway. In this study, we combine intermittent low-dose ERL ± SUL treatment in the polyposis in rat colon (Pirc) model with mechanistic studies on tumor-associated immune modulation. At clinically relevant doses, short-term (16 weeks) and long-term (46 weeks) ERL ± SUL administration results in near-complete tumor suppression in Pirc colon and duodenum (p < 0.0001). We identify a low-dose threshold for significant antitumor activity in Pirc rats given SUL at 125 ppm in the diet plus ERL at 5 mg/kg body weight via twice-weekly oral gavage (SUL125 + ERL5 × 2). Longitudinal analyses show diminished expression of MHC class I and II genes in polyps larger than Grade 5, a novel finding in the Pirc model. Treatment with ERL ± SUL upregulates the corresponding MHC and immune-associated factors in a subset of Pirc colon polyps, Pirc tumor cell lines, murine colon carcinoma cells, and FAP patient-derived organoids, with Nlrc5 playing a critical role in this effect. Imaging mass cytometry reveals that SUL125 + ERL5 × 2 increases tumor-associated Cd4<sup>+</sup> T cells by ~2.6-fold (p < 0.05), with no apparent effect on Cd8<sup>+</sup> T cells. The treatment also increases tumor-associated Cd68<sup>+</sup> cells (p < 0.05) and decreases Foxp3<sup>+</sup> (p < 0.01) and Arg1<sup>+</sup> (p < 0.05) cells. Thus, intermittent low-dose ERL + SUL treatment enhances tumor-associated MHC expression and remodels the immune cell niche toward a more permissive \"helper\" immune microenvironment.

Linagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor. It has been repurposed in recent experimental studies due to its marked anti-inflammatory activities. This study aimed to evaluate the ameliorative role of linagliptin in 1,2-dimethylhydrazine (DMH)-induced CRC via modulation of NFAT-mediated IL-6 and JAK2/STAT3/NF-κB signaling pathways. CRC model has been successfully established via a dose equal 40 mg/kg two times a week of DMH for 8-week duration. Twenty-four Wistar rats were segregated into three groups of eight rats each; normal control, DMH-induced CRC and DMH + linagliptin (10 mg/kg; p.o). Linagliptin attenuated DMH-induced oxidative stress by restoring the declined levels of some antioxidant enzymes. Linagliptin suppressed the elevated nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB) induced by DMH which is highlighted using immunohistochemistry analysis. The anti-inflammatory role of linagliptin has been fortified by the decline in nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) mRNA expression level along with the reduction in vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interlukin-6 (IL-6) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) levels. Linagliptin mitigate the protein expression of DMH-activated oncogenic janus-activated kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK2/STAT3). Linagliptin exerted a proapoptotic effect to tumor cells manifested by a remarkable decline in B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) and a significant elevation in Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) expression levels. The histopathological analysis revealed that linagliptin has inhibitory potential against the DMH induced dysplastic aberrant crypt foci (ACF) and adenocarcinoma.

A central regulatory mechanism of FOXO proteins is phosphorylation by the serine-threonine kinase Akt/protein kinase B (Akt/PKB), downstream of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), in response to insulin or several growth factors. Phosphorylation at three conserved residues results in the export of FOXO proteins from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, thereby decreasing expression of FOXO target genes. In contrast, the stress-activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and the energy sensing AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), upon oxidative and nutrient stress stimuli phosphorylate and activate FoxOs. Aside from PKB, JNK and AMPK, FOXOs are regulated by multiple players through several post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, but also acetylation, methylation and ubiquitylation.", "genes": ["100361025"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "40841811", "title": "High intensity interval training attenuate insulin resistance in diabetic rats accompanied by improvements in liver metabolism and spexin signaling.", "abstract": "Spexin (SPX), a recently identified adipokine, shows potential in enhancing insulin sensitivity, offering promising implications for metabolic health. This study aimed to investigate the effect of 8 weeks of high intensity interval training (HIIT) on insulin resistance through liver gluconeogenesis, lipolysis, inflammation, oxidative stress, and lipogenesis in Type 2 diabetic rats with a special focus on the role of SPX. In this study, 28 male Wistar rats were divided into four groups: Healthy Control (CON), Diabetes Control (T2D), HIIT, and Diabetes+HIIT (T2D+HIIT). After diabetes induction (high-fat diet+streptozotocin), the exercise groups underwent an 8-week HIIT protocol. HOMA-β, HOMA-IR, QUICKI, fasting blood sugar, insulin, and SPX were measured in liver and serum. The expression of Galanin/2, FOXO-1, PGC-1α, G6Pase, PEPCK, CPT1A, AMPK, PPARα, ACC, FAS, SREBP-1c, SIRT-1, and inflammatory/antioxidant markers were analyzed in the liver. Our results showed that HOMA-β, QUICKI, insulin, and serum level of SPX levels were higher in T2D+HIIT than T2D group. Similarly, SPX, GALR2, FOXO-1, PGC-1α, CPT1A, PPARα, AMPK, and SIRT-1 levels were higher in the livers of rats in the T2D+HIIT than T2D group. However, HOMA-IR, PEPCK, G6Pase, ACC, FAS, and SREBP-1c levels were lower in T2D+HIIT than T2D group. Also, HIIT+T2D reduced inflammation and increased antioxidants, indicating an improved overall health status of the liver. HIIT benefits diabetic liver with reducing gluconeogenesis, inflammation, oxidative stress, and lipogenesis while increasing lipolysis. These improvements coincided with elevated hepatic SPX signaling and are associated with reduced insulin resistance. These findings suggest a potential association between HIIT induced SPX signaling modulation in liver and improving insulin resistance, though further mechanistic studies are required to confirm the causality.", "authors": "Khoramipour K; Hosseini NS; Hill JW; Khoramipour K; Khoramipour K; Izquierdo SM; Lista S; Saheli M", "fulltext_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12370946/", "keywords": "FoxO signaling pathway[MeSH Terms] AND rat[MeSH Terms]", "llm_relevance_assessment": {"relevance_score": 8, "relevance_level": "High", "species_check": "The pathway is for Rattus norvegicus (rat), and the study uses male Wistar rats, which is a valid model organism for the pathway.", "evidence_summary": "The expression of FOXO-1 was analyzed in the liver.

METHODS: We used public datasets to obtain synovial tissue genes of healthy people and RA patients, screened differentially expressed genes (DEGs) of RA, and intersected with the human autophagy gene database (HADb) to obtain RA autophagy genes. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis and single-gene genome enrichment analysis were performed. The diagnostic value of RA core autophagy genes in the validation set was screened and verified. The immune cell correlation analysis of RA autophagy core genes was performed to obtain the correlation between single disease autophagy core genes and immune cells. Finally, we prepared CIA rat models to verify the autophagy protein P62, Beclin-1 and the 11 core genes associated with RA-autophagy. RESULTS: A total of 1098 RA DEGs were obtained. Intersecting with 222 autophagy genes obtained from the HADb database yielded 27 RA autophagy genes. GO analysis of RA autophagy genes showed 307 biological mechanisms. KEGG enrichment analysis obtained 86 signaling pathways, including FoxO, Necroptosis and other pathways related to RA autophagy. GSEA analysis found that the control group had a higher correlation with adipokine signaling pathways and others. And 11 RA autophagy-related core genes (IFNG, EGFR, MYC, CXCR4, MAPK8, CASP1, TNFSF10, CTSB, FAS, FOXO1, FOXO3) were obtained by screening the PPI network, and there were differences in expression in the training set (P < 0.001). External validation set verification showed diagnostic efficacy. Analysis of immune infiltration in RA autophagy-related genes revealed 14 immune cell types differentially abundant in synovial tissues of RA patients vs. normal controls. Significant correlations exist between autophagy genes and immune subsets. Finally, animal experiments showed that joint autophagy was enhanced (P < 0.001), and the mRNA of 11 RA-autophagy core genes had significant changes (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: We systematically identified 11 autophagy-related core genes as potential therapeutic targets for RA. Our CIA model validation provides preclinical evidence supporting their translational potential. These genes showed significant correlations with 14 synovial immune cell subtypes, may serve as novel therapeutic targets by modulating immune infiltration and inflammatory pathways.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, the chemical components of QJSB and serum constituents were identified using UPLC-Q-Qrbitrap HRMS technology. The potential anti-leukopenia mechanism and crucial components of QJSB was deciphered using combined approaches of transcriptomic analysis and network pharmacology analysis. Finally, the expression of key targets and the intervene effects of QJSB in the cyclophosphamide-induced leukopenia model of rats was verified by in vivo experiments. RESULTS: In total, 51 and 58 chemical components were identified from QJSB and serum respectively. The network pharmacology analysis indicated that the key components of QJSB was genistein, quercetin, 5,6,7-trimethoxyisoflavone, carbacyclin, linoleic acid, and caffeic acid, the key targets were PTPN11, LCK, STAT3, GRB2, FYN, SRC, PIK3R1, LYN, EGFR, PIK3CA, and the key pathways were PI3K-Akt, lipid and atherosclerosis, JAK-STAT, FoxO, and linoleic acid metabolism. Transcriptomics analysis revealed that 1171 genes were down-regulated and 382 genes were up-regulated by QJSB compared with model group. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis indicated that the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway is closely related to leukopenia.

Shenqi Tiaoshen formula (, SQTS) in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) by utilizing network pharmacology, molecular docking, and experimental verification. METHODS: Multiple open-source databases and research related to Traditional Chinese Medicine or compounds were employed to screen active ingredients and corresponding potential targets of the SQTS. The protein-protein interaction network screened hub genes, the relevant molecular mechanism and gene regulation were initially identified through the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis, and molecular docking was used to confirm further the interaction of the main components bound to the core targets. In vivo experiments on the COPD combined Qi-deficiency syndrome rat model were performed to verify the intervention effects and predicted potential molecular mechanisms of the SQTS. RESULTS: This study selected 156 active compounds and 326 candidate targets for treating COPD. Quercetin, Nobiletin, Kaempferol, Luteolin, Ginsenoside Rh2 and Formononetin were probably the main active compounds of SQTS in COPD treatment as they affected the most COPD-related targets, and interleukin-1 (IL-6), signal transducing activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), protein kinase B (AKT1), hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α), and forkhead box O3 (FoxO3) were identified as the hub genes associated with its therapeutic effect. KEGG analysis was mainly enriched in the signaling pathways closely related to inflammation, immunity and oxidative stress, such as HIF-1, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3K)-AKT, FoxO, apoptosis, IL-17, and toll-like receptor. Molecular docking confirmed that the main active components shared a good affinity with the hub genes. <i>In vivo</i> experiments, the SQTS was found to improve the body weight, exhaustive swimming time, tail-hanging immobility time and struggle times, airway inflammation, lung functions, and inflammatory factors in the rat model of COPD. The up-regulation of p-PI3K, p-AKT, HIF-1α, FoxO3α, toll like receptor 4, VEGFA, Caspase 3, TNF-α, and IL-17 in COPD rats were down-regulated by SQTS, consistent with the network pharmacology results.

In humans and mice, the pathway consists of the MST1 and MST2 kinases, their cofactor Salvador and LATS1 and LATS2. In response to high cell densities, activated LATS1/2 phosphorylates the transcriptional coactivators YAP and TAZ, promoting its cytoplasmic localization, leading to cell apoptosis and restricting organ size overgrowth. When the Hippo pathway is inactivated at low cell density, YAP/TAZ translocates into the nucleus to bind to the transcription enhancer factor (TEAD/TEF) family of transcriptional factors to promote cell growth and proliferation. YAP/TAZ also interacts with other transcriptional factors or signaling molecules, by which Hippo pathway-mediated processes are interconnected with those of other key signaling cascades, such as those mediated by TGF-beta and Wnt growth factors.", "genes": ["100360552"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "41104600", "title": "Dl-3-n-Butylphthalide Inhibits Autophagy to Alleviate the Neuronal Apoptosis After Spinal Cord Injury by Elevating YAP via Inactivating the Hippo Signaling Pathway.", "abstract": "Dl-3-n-Butylphthalide (NBP) has been reported to relieve neuronal damage by suppressing excessive autophagy.

As a result, the activated Hippo pathway, decreased YAP protein, and increased p-YAP, Beclin 1, and LC3 II/I proteins were monitored in peripheral blood of SCI patients.

YAP silencing reversed the suppression of NBP on the OGD-induced PC12 cell apoptosis and autophagy. In vivo, the inhibition of NBP on neuronal injury, the Hippo/YAP pathway activity, and autophagy was abolished by YAP silencing.

Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1), a downstream transcriptional coactivator regulated by the Hippo signaling pathway, has been shown to be involved in liver fibrosis. YAP activity is modulated by G-protein coupled receptors, including Gα s-coupled protein dopamine receptor D1 (DRD1). Levodopa, a dopamine precursor, activates DRD1 on cell surface, triggering its downstream signaling pathway. AIM: To investigate the therapeutic effect of levodopa and the downstream mechanism on carbon tetrachloride (CCl<sub>4</sub>)-induced liver fibrosis, including liver DRD1 expression. METHODS: SD rats were intraperitoneally injected with 40% CCl<sub>4</sub> for 8 weeks to induce liver fibrosis, followed by treatment with varying doses of levodopa for 2 weeks. Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were measured, and liver pathology was assessed using hematoxylin and eosin and Masson's staining. Alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) content, along with the expressions of DRD1, YAP, and phosphorylated protein, was analyzed by Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and reverse transcription-quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Compared with the controls, levodopa-treated rats showed a decrease in the proportion of collagen in the liver and a recovery from liver fibrosis (<i>P</i> = 0.0007). Western blot and immunohistochemistry indicated that DRD1 was upregulated in the fibrotic liver of rats treated with levodopa, showing an increase in DRD1 Level (<i>P</i> < 0.0001). In addition, the upregulation of DRD1 activated the Hippo signaling pathway, manifested as increased YAP phosphorylation (<i>P</i> < 0.05).

Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) offers the advantage of multi-component, multi-target therapy for RA; however, its ability to simultaneously target multiple key pathological mechanisms of RA remains to be further investigated. Fuhu Lijie Tang (FHLJT) is a novel TCM formulation with potential therapeutic effects on RA, and its anti-arthritic mechanisms require systematic study. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to comprehensively investigate the anti-arthritic effects of FHLJT and its underlying molecular mechanisms, focusing on its potential to simultaneously target multiple key pathological mechanisms in the treatment of RA. METHODS: Collagen II-induced arthritic (CIA) rats received FHLJT treatment, with therapeutic effects assessed through arthritis scoring, paw swelling measurement, inflammatory marker analysis, and histopathology. Synovial tissue transcriptomics identified differentially expressed genes, followed by validation through Western blot, immunohistochemistry, ELISA, and flow cytometry to validate these findings. RESULTS: FHLJT significantly reduced joint inflammation and histopathological damage in CIA rats. Transcriptomic analyses showed that FHLJT downregulated multiple RA-associated pathways, including RA signaling, T cell receptor (TCR), B cell receptor (BCR), vascular endothelial growth factor, osteoclast differentiation, antigen presentation, phagosome, and protein modification pathways. Further interaction analysis identified the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) - protein kinase B (Akt) and AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) signaling pathways as central to these processes. Experimental validation confirmed that FHLJT inhibited citrullinated proteins, peptidyl arginine deiminase 2 (PADI2), PADI4, interferon gamma inducible protein 30, and CD74 expression in joint tissues of CIA rats. It also suppressed phosphorylated zeta chain of T cell receptor associated protein kinase 70 (p-ZAP70)/ZAP70, inducible T cell costimulator, programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1), interleukin-17 levels in the TCR pathway, and reduced phosphorylated tyrosine-protein kinase Lyn (p-LYN)/LYN, phosphorylated Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate (p-Rac)/Rac, and anti-type II collagen antibody levels in the BCR pathway.

{"id": "rno04152", "name": "AMPK signaling pathway - Rattus norvegicus (rat)", "description": "AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a serine threonine kinase that is highly conserved through evolution. AMPK system acts as a sensor of cellular energy status. It is activated by increases in the cellular AMP:ATP ratio caused by metabolic stresses that either interfere with ATP production (eg, deprivation for glucose or oxygen) or that accelerate ATP consumption (eg, muscle contraction). Several upstream kinases, including liver kinase B1 (LKB1), calcium/calmodulin kinase kinase-beta (CaMKK beta), and TGF-beta-activated kinase-1 (TAK-1), can activate AMPK by phosphorylating a threonine residue on its catalytic alpha-subunit. Once activated, AMPK leads to a concomitant inhibition of energy-consuming biosynthetic pathways, such as protein, fatty acid and glycogen synthesis, and activation of ATP-producing catabolic pathways, such as fatty acid oxidation and glycolysis.", "genes": ["100362453"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "41251844", "title": "Piracetam attenuates oxidative stress and inflammation-induced neuronal cell death in rats with vascular dementia potentially via the activation of the AMPK/SIRT-1/Nrf-2 signaling pathway.", "abstract": "Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) is the second leading cause of dementia and a major contributor to vascular dementia (VaD). Among the mechanisms underlying CCH-induced cognitive decline, programmed cell death plays a pivotal role. Lytic forms of programmed cell death, including necroptosis and pyroptosis, have recently been identified as consequences of chronic inflammation. However, their precise involvement in VaD remains unclear. It has been demonstrated that piracetam has neuroprotective and cognitive-enhancing properties, potentially through anti-inflammatory and antioxidant mechanisms. Nevertheless, its effects in the context of VaD have not yet been fully investigated. This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential of piracetam and elucidate any underlying mechanisms. Male Wistar rats underwent bilateral common carotid artery occlusion to induce CCH. Following this procedure, the rats received either piracetam (600 mg/kg) or resveratrol (20 mg/kg) daily for 28 days. Before euthanasia, cognitive performance was assessed using the Morris water maze test. Then biochemical analyses, including Western blotting and immunohistochemistry, were performed to assess markers of oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, pyroptosis, and necroptosis. Our findings demonstrated that piracetam reduced oxidative stress, suppressed neuroinflammatory responses, enhanced superoxide dismutase activity, and provided protection against pyroptotic and necroptotic cell death. Mechanistic studies showed that piracetam activated AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which in turn upregulated sirtuin 1 (SIRT-1) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf-2), leading to improved cognitive performance.

Published research have evidenced the involvement of METTL3, a critical mRNA m<sup>6</sup>A methyltransferase, in the generation of various cardiovascular diseases. However, its specific role in regulating IAs remains unclear. Our research demonstrated downregulation of METTL3 in IA patients and a significant positive correlation with AMPK expression. In vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), overexpressing METTL3 led to an upregulation of contractile marker genes (SM-22α & α-SMA), while the expressions of TNF-α, IL-1β, iNOS, IL-6, MMP-9, and MMP-3 were significantly downregulated. This effect was reversed by the use of the AMPK inhibitor Compound C. Therefore, it can be postulated that METTL3 may regulate the phenotypic transformation of VSMCs by mediating the AMPK signaling pathway. Additionally, overexpression of METTL3 can suppress the proliferation and migration of VSMCs and promote cell apoptosis. Conversely, overexpressing METTL3 in this rat IA model resulted in improved vessel morphology, enhanced wall thickness, and elevated expression of genes, SM-22α and α-SMA. However, these beneficial effects were reduced following treatment with Compound C. Furthermore, we observed higher immunofluorescence intensity of the M1 macrophage marker CD68 in IA mice compared to significantly lower levels in rats overexpressing METTL3. These results suggest that AMPK inhibition may be mediated by METTL3, which would limit macrophage infiltration and hence prevent the development of IAs.

Shugan Xiaozhi decoction (SX), a composite Chinese medicinal formula, has shown therapeutic potential for NASH, although the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely defined. In this study, the effects and mechanisms of SX in rats with NASH and fibrosis induced by a high-fat and high-cholesterol (HFHC) diet were investigated. METHODS: NASH rats with fibrosis were induced by an HFHC diet, with different doses of SX administered. Biochemical indices, histological changes, and gene expression were assessed to evaluate lipid metabolism, inflammation, fibrosis of the liver. The histological changes of white and brown adipose tissue were also determined. Hepatic transcriptomics and network pharmacology based on the blood components were employed to elucidate the biological processes and signaling pathways, which was subsequently verified, and the material basis of SX was investigated through docking simulations. RESULTS: SX treatment effectively corrected disordered lipid profiles, mitigated hepatic phagocyte infiltration, and alleviated damage in the white and brown adipose tissues. It also downregulated the expression of NLRP3, caspase-1, IL-1β, α-SMA, Col1a1, and TGF-β, to improve hepatic inflammation and fibrosis. Mechanistically, transcriptomics and network pharmacology analyses revealed that SX ameliorated hepatic oxidative stress and activated the AMPK pathway, and the downstream effector Nrf2 and inactivated of SREBP1/FAS signaling. Three putative phytochemicals, namely, gallic acid, protocatechuic acid, and rhein with the highest binding affinity for AMPKα were also identified.

Throughout the course of the disease, β-cell function fails and insulin production decreases. Studying the molecular systems responsible for insulin production, release, and action is crucial for the management and treatment of the disease. Thus, this study aimed to scrutinize the therapeutic efficacies of oxytocin (OXT) on nicotinamide (NA)/streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetes in rats and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Wistar rats were supplied a single intraperitoneal (<i>i.p.</i>) dose of NA (120 mg/kg) 15 min before an <i>i.p.</i> injection of STZ (60 mg/kg) after fasting for 16 h. Ten days later, the diabetic rats were orally administered OXT every day for eight weeks at dose levels 0.5, 1, and 2 IU/kg. RESULTS: The treatment of diabetic rats with OXT significantly improved oral glucose tolerance, serum insulin and C-peptide concentrations, and pancreatic islets' structure and function. Furthermore, the activities of liver glucose-6-phospatase and glycogen phosphorylase significantly decreased. OXT treatment also resulted in an increase in serum adiponectin levels, while the levels of serum resistin, omentin, vaspin, and free fatty acids significantly decreased. Additionally, OXT significantly alleviated the mRNA levels of components of the PI3K-AKT and AMPK signaling pathways as well as their effectors including PPARγ, insulin receptor (IR), IR substrates 1 and 2 (IRS1 & IRS2), PI3K, AKT, AMPK, and glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) in visceral adipose tissues of diabetic rats. CONCLUSION: OXT can exert antidiabetic effects and may be useful for developing multiple targeted therapeutic strategies for diabetes treatment.

diet-induced obesity and inflammation via gut microbiota, AMPK-mediated metabolism, and NF-κB pathway.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Obesity is typically identified by a high body mass index. Chronic inflammation is a central characteristic of obesity, contributing to many complications. The unrelenting rise in obesity and inflammation has been a global crisis. Due to the weight loss effects of black tea and anti-inflammatory effect of polyphenols, Theaflavins (TFs), the major bioactive polyphenols of black tea, may provide new strategies against obesity and inflammation. PURPOSE: This study aimed to investigate the potential regulatory roles and the underlying molecular mechanism of TFs on obesity and obesity-related inflammation. STUDY DESIGN: Animal experiments were performed using high-fat diet induced obese SD rats. TFs were orally administered at doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg·kg⁻¹ for 8 consecutive weeks. The rats' weight and length were recorded. The blood, liver, epididymal fat pads, colon, interscapular adipose tissue, and feces were collected and stored. METHODS: TFs' effects on obesity and inflammation were evaluated by body weight (daily observation) and inflammatory cytokines (ELISA). The lipid deposition and hepatic function was examined using biochemical assessment and histopathological analysis. AMPK-mediated metabolism assessed by Western blotting (WB), immunohistochemistry, and qRT-PCR. The intestinal barrier integrity was evaluated by biochemical assessment, histopathological analysis, WB, qRT-PCR, and immunofluorescence staining. Gut microbiota and fecal metabolites were using 16S rRNA sequencing and LC-MS/MS analysis, respectively. RESULTS: TFs exerted protective effects by mitigating body weight, lipid deposition, and immune response in the whole body, adipose tissues, and colon. The underlying mechanism was associated with the gut microbiota, AMPK-mediated metabolism, and NF-κB pathway. Specifically, TFs promoted the potential probiotics (Alistipes, Akkermansia, Coprococcus, NK4A214_group, Collinsella, and Rikenellaceae_RC9_gut_group) and regulated metabolic pathway (starch and sucrose metabolism, α-linolenic acid metabolism, and glycine‑serine-threonine metabolism), thereby inhibiting TRL4/MyD88/NF-κB pathway and protecting the intestinal barrier. Moreover, TFs activated the AMPK/SREBP-1 pathway and AMPK/SIRT1/PGC-1α/UCP1 pathway to mitigate the lipid metabolism and energy metabolism, respectively. CONCLUSION: We have innovatively demonstrated for the first time that TFs could alleviate the obesity and systemic inflammation via the modulation of gut microbiota and AMPK-mediated metabolism in HFD-fed rats. The impacts on white adipose tissue browning and thermogenic activity of brown adipose tissue of theaflavins firstly proposed a potential mechanism underlying the protection of theaflavins through the gut microbiota-liver/adipose tissue axis.

While adenine, a purine compound, exhibits anti-inflammatory properties, its effects on VSMC inflammation remain poorly characterized. This investigation examined adenine's impact on proinflammatory mediators in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated rat aortic smooth muscle cells (A7r5) and elucidated the underlying mechanisms. Cell viability, gene expression, cytokine secretion, and signaling pathways were evaluated using MTT assay, qPCR, ELISA, and western blotting techniques. Results demonstrated that adenine concentrations ≤400 μM maintained A7r5 cell viability while significantly suppressing LPS-induced mRNA expression and protein production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFα), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-1β, and IL-8. Additionally, LPS increased inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression and nitric oxide production. Mechanistic analysis revealed that LPS treatment reduced p53 phosphorylation while enhancing ERK, JNK, and p38 phosphorylation alongside NF-κB activation. Co-treatment with adenine and LPS activated AMPK signaling, increased p53 phosphorylation, and simultaneously reduced ERK phosphorylation and NF-κB activation. AMPK inhibition abolished adenine-induced p53 phosphorylation, restored ERK and NF-κB activation, and reversed the suppression of proinflammatory mediator production. Furthermore, combined inhibition of ERK, NF-κB, and p53 pathways enhanced adenine's inhibitory effects on NF-κB activation and inflammatory mediator production. In conclusion, adenine effectively attenuates inflammatory mediator expression and secretion in LPS-stimulated A7r5 cells by modulating the AMPK/p53/NF-κB signaling cascade.

Although SXT is widely used for the treatment of ischemic diseases, its effect on skin flap survival is still unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study evaluated shuxuetong injection's specific molecular mechanisms on flap necrosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An improved McFarlane skin flap model was established. 48 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to four groups: control (equal volume of saline), low-dose (0.5 ml/kg/day), medium-dose (1.5 ml/kg/day), and high-dose (3 ml/kg/day). All groups received continuous intraperitoneal injections for 7 days. On the 7th day following surgery, the flap survival area was measured. Blood perfusion was measured via laser Doppler flowmetry, and oxidative stress levels were quantified with commercial assay kits. Histopathological status of the flap was assessed using hematoxylin-eosin staining, and immunofluorescence was adopted to detect inflammation-relevant proteins' expression. Additionally, a glucose-oxygen deprivation model was established using HUVECs, which were classified into five groups: control (equal volume of saline), low-dose (1 μL/ml), medium-dose (5 μL/ml), high-dose (10 μL/ml), and TLR4 agonist (RS 09). Cell viability and migration were detected using CCK8 and transwell assays, respectively. The expression of proteins involved in the TLR4/NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathway and pyroptosis was analyzed by Western blotting. RESULTS: SXT significantly alleviated OGD/R-induced endothelial injury in HUVECs. Mechanistically, SXT inhibited pyroptosis by suppressing the TLR4/NF-κB/NLRP3 signaling pathway. The use of the TLR4 agonist RS 09 further verified the pivotal role of this pathway in regulating pyroptosis. In vivo, SXT enhanced flap blood perfusion, suppressed pyroptosis and inflammation, thereby markedly improving the survival rate of ischemic skin flaps in rats.

We previously reported that short-term treatment with SLO at relatively high concentrations (10-1000 ng/mL) diminished acetylcholine-induced, endothelial-dependent relaxation in a concentration-dependent manner. However, the vascular function effects of long-term exposure to SLO at lower concentrations are poorly understood. In this study, treatment of rat aorta with endothelium with SLO (0.1-10 ng/mL) for 72 hours inhibited contractions in response to norepinephrine and phenylephrine in a concentration-dependent manner, and this effect was abolished by endothelium denudation. We also observed decreased endothelium-dependent relaxation in aorta treated with a lower concentration of SLO (10 ng/mL) for 72 hours. Long-term treatment with SLO (10 ng/mL) increased the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in aorta with endothelium but not aorta without endothelium, and the SLO-induced decrease in contraction was restored by treatment with iNOS inhibitors. Pharmacologic and gene-mutant analyses further indicated that SLO-induced vascular dysfunction and iNOS upregulation are mediated through the toll-like receptor 4/NADPH oxidase 2/reactive oxygen species/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways. In vivo SLO treatment (46.8 pg/kg per minute) for 7 days also diminished vascular contraction and relaxation activity in aorta with endothelium. We concluded that long-term treatment with SLO inhibits vascular contractile responses, primarily due to increased iNOS expression in the endothelium through toll-like receptor 4-mediated pathways. Our present results, together with those of our previous study, suggest that endothelial cells play a key role in the pathophysiologic changes in cardiovascular function associated with long-term exposure to SLO. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: In the present study, we showed that long-term exposure to streptococcal exotoxin streptolysin O (SLO) inhibits agonist-induced contraction in rat aorta with endothelium, driven primarily by elevated nitric oxide synthase production via NADPH oxidase 2-mediated reactive oxygen species production through toll-like receptor 4 activation on endothelial cells.

Our study revealed that DHC increased the mRNA and protein levels of rat VSMC contractile phenotype markers, such as calponin 1 (Cnn1), myosin heavy chain (Myh11, SM-MHC), smooth muscle 22α (Sm22α), and alpha-smooth muscle actin (Acta2, α-SMA) in a time- and dose-dependent manner. Additionally, DHC inhibited platelet-derived growth factor-BB-induced VSMC proliferation and migration. In Apoe<sup>-/-</sup> mice, DHC treatment resulted in reduced carotid plaque areas and macrophage infiltration, along with increased contractile phenotype marker expression. RNA sequencing analysis revealed a significant upregulation of spectrin alpha, erythrocytic 1 (Spta1) in DHC-treated rat VSMCs. Strikingly, Spta1 knockdown effectively negated the increase in contractile phenotype marker expression in VSMCs that was initially prompted by DHC. Therefore, DHC preserves the VSMC contractile phenotype through Spta1, thereby attenuating carotid artery atherosclerotic plaques in Apoe<sup>-/-</sup> mice.

Understanding this behavior is essential for optimizing therapeutic doses and anticipating possible side effects prior to clinical trials. The objective of this study is to provide a more detailed characterization and investigation of the mechanisms of action of limonene on the contractile tonus of isolated aorta.The experiments were carried out on aortic rings isolated from rats, subjected to isometric recording of contractions in their circular smooth muscle and exposed to different concentrations of limonene. It was found that limonene blocked the contraction induced by KCl (60 mM), but had a biphasic effect on the contraction induced by phenylephrine (0.1 μM). At lower concentrations, limonene was able to amplify the contraction induced by phenylephrine, while at higher concentrations, it inhibited it. The nitric oxide synthase blockers L-NAME and ruthenium red, a TRP ion channel blocker, did not significantly interfere with the biphasic character of limonene. However, indomethacin, a blocker of arachidonic acid derivatives, completely blocked the amplification of contraction induced by phenylephrine.

Our study aimed to figure out the role of phoenixin-14 in VSMC phenotypic switching during the pathogenesis of IA by using both cellular and animal models. Primary rat VSMCs were isolated from the Willis circle of male Sprague-Dawley rats. VSMCs were stimulated by hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) to establish a cell oxidative damage model. After pretreatment with phoenixin-14 and exposure to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, VSMC viability, migration, and invasion were examined through cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8), wound healing, and Transwell assays. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in VSMCs was evaluated by using 2',7'-Dichlorofluorescin diacetate (DCFH-DA) fluorescence probes and flow cytometry. Rat IA models were established by ligation of the left common carotid arteries and posterior branches of both renal arteries. The histopathological changes of rat intracranial blood vessels were observed through hematoxylin and eosin staining. The levels of contractile phenotype markers (alpha-smooth muscle actin [α-SMA] and smooth muscle 22 alpha [SM22α]) in VSMCs and rat arterial rings were determined through real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot analysis.

METHODS: Isometric tension recording was performed in HUV rings pre-contracted with K<sup>+</sup>. Hesperetin relaxing mechanism was investigated using a LTCC opener (BayK8644) and blockers of cyclic nucleotides and phosphodiesterases (PDEs). Whole-cell patch-clamping in A7r5 cells, a rat vascular smooth muscle cell line, was performed to study the effect of hesperetin on LTCC current. RESULTS: After depolarizing precontraction, hesperetin induced HUV relaxation concentration-dependently and endothelium-independently; 1 mmol/L hesperetin reduced denuded HUV ring tension by 68.7% ± 4.3% compared to matching vehicle, osmolality, and time controls (P<0.0001). Importantly, hesperetin competitively inhibited BayK8644-induced contraction, shifting the half maximal effective concentration of BayK8644 response from 1.08 nmol/L [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.49-2.40] in vehicle control to 11.30 nmol/L (95% CI 5.45-23.41) in hesperetin (P=0.0001). Moreover, hesperetin elicited further vasorelaxation in denuded HUV rings pretreated with inhibitors of soluble guanylyl cyclase, adenylyl cyclase, PDE3, PDE4, and PDE5 (P<0.01), while rings pretreated with PDE1 inhibitors could not be relaxed by hesperetin (P>0.05). However, simultaneously applying inhibitors of soluble guanylyl cyclase and adenylyl cyclase could not inhibit hesperetin's effect (P>0.05). In whole-cell patch-clamping, hesperetin rapidly decreased LTCC current in A7r5 cells to 66.7% ± 5.8% (P=0.0104). CONCLUSIONS: Hesperetin diminishes depolarizing contraction of human vascular smooth muscle through inhibition of LTCC, and not cyclic nucleotides nor PDEs.

The binding of VEGF to VEGFR-2 leads to a cascade of different signaling pathways, resulting in the up-regulation of genes involved in mediating the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells and promoting their survival and vascular permeability. For example, the binding of VEGF to VEGFR-2 leads to dimerization of the receptor, followed by intracellular activation of the PLCgamma;PKC-Raf kinase-MEK-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and subsequent initiation of DNA synthesis and cell growth, whereas activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3' -kinase (PI3K)-Akt pathway leads to increased endothelial-cell survival.

"ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Chrysanthemum morifolium has long been utilized in Traditional Chinese Medicine to improve visual acuity and alleviate ocular damage. Although recent pharmacological studies highlight its antioxidant and vasoprotective effects, its efficacy against neovascular processes in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) has not been established. AIM OF THE STUDY: This study aimed to investigate the therapeutic potential and underlying mechanisms of Chrysanthemum morifolium extract (CME) in managing neovascular AMD, emphasizing its effects on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-mediated angiogenesis and oxidative stress regulation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In vitro, ARPE-19 human retinal pigment epithelial cells underwent hypoxic and oxidative stress assays to measure VEGF, hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α), and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) pathway activation. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were treated with a conditioned medium (CM) from CME-exposed ARPE-19 cells to assess migration, invasion, and tube formation. In vivo therapeutic efficacy was validated in cobalt chloride (CoCl<sub>2</sub>)-induced zebrafish and laser-induced rat choroidal neovascularization (CNV) models. RESULTS: CME significantly attenuated hypoxia- and CoCl<sub>2</sub>-induced upregulation of VEGF and HIF-1α, enhanced Nrf2 signaling, and reduced reactive oxygen species (ROS) in ARPE-19 cells. CME-CM markedly suppressed HUVEC migration, invasion, and angiogenesis. In zebrafish and rat CNV models, CME treatment significantly reduced neovascular lesion area and preserved retinal architecture in a dose-dependent manner, without evident toxicity.

world's population is affected by gastric ulcers, which can result in gastrointestinal perforation and bleeding. Consequently, we aimed to investigate whether blocking TNF-α type 1 receptor (TNFR1) with CAY10500 could diminish experimentally induced gastric ulcer (GU) in rats by modulating vascularization. METHODS: Rats were administered with a single oral dose of 80 mg/kg of indomethacin to produce gastric ulcers. Subsequently, some rats were given 1 mg/kg of CAY10500 orally. Gastric samples were used to assess the genetic expression and protein levels of TNFR1, VEGF, ERK, PI3K, AKT (also known as PKB), and ICAM-1. Gastric sections underwent electron microscopic examination and were subjected to hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunostaining using anti-TNFR1, anti-VEGF, and anti-ICAM-1 antibodies. RESULTS: CAY10500 demonstrated the ability to inhibit the expression of TNFR1. Examination of micro-images of GU using electron microscopy or H/E staining revealed extensive necrosis, resulting in the complete loss of regular ultrastructural features of epithelial nuclei and cytoplasmic organelles, as well as the loss of tight junctions and disruption of cell membranes. Significantly, the administration of CAY10500 mitigated these effects. Furthermore, CAY10500 significantly elevated the expressions of VEGF, ERK, PI3K, and AKT, which was associated with a significant reduction in the expression of ICAM-1.

To assess the functional effect of methotrexate on hepatic one-carbon metabolism, we have developed and applied tracer kinetic techniques in vivo to quantify the carbon flux through the folate-dependent one-carbon pool in rats. Following a 7-day treatment period with methotrexate (0.2 mg/kg body weight), the tracers L-[ring-2-14C] histidine and L-[methyl-3H] methionine were simultaneously infused into control and methotrexate-treated rats. Methotrexate treatment decreased hepatic tetrahydrofolate, methyltetrahydrofolate, and formyltetrahydrofolate, concentrations by 63, 83, and 58%, respectively. Furthermore, the enzymatic activity of 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase, the terminal enzyme in the catabolism of the ring-2-carbon of histidine to CO2, was diminished by 32% in methotrexate-treated animals. These changes in enzyme activity and folate coenzyme concentrations did not result in a significant decrease in the oxidative flow of carbon from histidine to CO2 in methotrexate-treated rats compared to control animals (2.40 and 3.22 micromol/h/kg3/4, respectively). Oxidative carbon flow was reflective of tetrahydrofolate and formyltetrahydrofolate pools when expressed as a percent of total folate: neither coenzyme pool was diminished as a result of methotrexate treatment. In contrast, the reductive carbon flux through the one-carbon pool from histidine to methionine was significantly decreased 59% in methotrexate-treated (7.63 micromol/h/kg3/4) versus control rats (18.73 micromol/h/kg3/4)). Likewise, methyltetrahydrofolate, as a percent of total folate, was reduced 51% in methotrexate-treated rats. Consequently, total measured carbon flow (oxidative+reductive) was 54% lower in rats subjected to subchronic methotrexate treatment.

Levodopa, a dopamine precursor, activates DRD1 on cell surface, triggering its downstream signaling pathway. AIM: To investigate the therapeutic effect of levodopa and the downstream mechanism on carbon tetrachloride (CCl<sub>4</sub>)-induced liver fibrosis, including liver DRD1 expression. METHODS: SD rats were intraperitoneally injected with 40% CCl<sub>4</sub> for 8 weeks to induce liver fibrosis, followed by treatment with varying doses of levodopa for 2 weeks. Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels were measured, and liver pathology was assessed using hematoxylin and eosin and Masson's staining. Alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) content, along with the expressions of DRD1, YAP, and phosphorylated protein, was analyzed by Western blot, immunohistochemistry, and reverse transcription-quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Compared with the controls, levodopa-treated rats showed a decrease in the proportion of collagen in the liver and a recovery from liver fibrosis (<i>P</i> = 0.0007).

Venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV ECMO) support for patients with ARDS has increased significantly worldwide. However, it remains unknown whether Dex could improve the efficiency of VV ECMO to reduce lung injury. Here, we investigate the combined efficiency of VV ECMO and Dex in rats with acute lung injury (ALI). METHODS: We established VV ECMO in oleic acid (OA)-treated ALI rats and administered Dex. We conducted HE staining and evaluated lung and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid cytokines to assess lung injury and inflammation. Furthermore, we investigated the activation of Hippo/YAP signalling in alveolar epithelial type II cell (AT2)-mediated alveolar epithelial repair using quantitative PCR, Western blotting and immunofluorescence. In vitro, the human alveolar epithelial cell line A549 was used to investigate the key role of YAP in alveolar epithelial cell differentiation. RESULTS: VV ECMO combined with Dex alleviated OA-induced lung injury and pulmonary inflammation. Pulmonary oedema and exudation were significantly alleviated, and the lung and BAL levels of IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-α were significantly reduced compared with those observed with ECMO alone. In addition, VV ECMO combined with Dex treatment protected alveolar epithelial cells by activating Hippo/YAP signalling. In vitro, Dex promoted YAP expression and alveolar epithelial cell differentiation, whereas YAP knockdown inhibited YAP-mediated differentiation.

In vivo, Th17 differentiation requires antigen presentation and co-stimulation, and activation of antigen presenting-cells (APCs) to produce TGF-beta, IL-6, IL-1, IL-23 and IL-21. This initial activation results in the activation and up-regulation of STAT3, ROR(gamma)t and other transcriptional factors in CD4+ T cells, which bind to the promoter regions of the IL-17, IL-21 and IL-22 genes and induce IL-17, IL-21 and IL-22. In contrast, the differentiation of Th17 cells and their IL-17 expression are negatively regulated by IL-2, Th2 cytokine IL-4, IL-27 and Th1 cytokine IFN-gamma through STAT5, STAT6 and STAT1 activation, respectively. Retinoid acid and the combination of IL-2 and TGF-beta upregulate Foxp3, which also downregulates cytokines like IL-17 and IL-21. The inhibition of Th17 differentiation may serve as a protective strategy to 'fine-tune' the expression IL-17 so it does not cause excessive inflammation.

The majority of urothelial carcinoma are bladder carcinomas, and urothelial carcinomas of the renal pelvis and ureter account for only approximately 7% of the total. Urothelial tumours arise and evolve through divergent phenotypic pathways. Some tumours progress from urothelial hyperplasia to low-grade non-invasive superficial papillary tumours. More aggressive variants arise either from flat, high-grade carcinoma in situ (CIS) and progress to invasive tumours, or they arise de novo as invasive tumours. Low-grade papillary tumors frequently show a constitutive activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase-Ras pathway, exhibiting activating mutations in the HRAS and fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) genes. In contrast, CIS and invasive tumors frequently show alterations in the TP53 and RB genes and pathways.

{"id": "rno04613", "name": "Neutrophil extracellular trap formation - Rattus norvegicus (rat)", "description": "Neutrophils play a central role in innate immune defense. One of the mechanisms of neutrophil action is the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), the extracellular structures composed of chromatin coated with histones, proteases and granular and cytosolic proteins that help catch and kill microorganisms. NETs are formed by a process known as \"NETosis\" that can be triggered by microorganisms and endogenous stimuli, such as damage-associated molecular patterns and immune complexes, and involves activation in most cases of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-oxidase, which produces reactive oxygen species (ROS). Recent study has reported that there are two different mechanisms of NETosis, including a lytic NETosis and a vital NETosis. Lytic NETosis begins with nuclear delobulation and the disassembly of the nuclear envelope and continues with loss of cellular polarization, chromatin decondensation and plasma membrane rupture. Vital NETosis can occur independently of cell death and involves the secreted expulsion of nuclear chromatin that is accompanied by the release of granule proteins through degranulation.", "genes": ["100359421"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "40647346", "title": "High-Calorie Diets Exacerbate Lipopolysaccharide-Induced Pneumonia by Promoting Propionate-Mediated Neutrophil Extracellular Traps.", "abstract": "<b>Objectives</b>: High-calorie diets are linked to increased risks of chronic inflammation and immune dysfunction, yet their role in modulating pneumonia severity remains unclear. Focusing on the interactions among gut-originating short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), neutrophil function, and histone deacetylases (HDACs), this research examined the exacerbating effects of a high-calorie diet on pneumonia in rats. <b>Methods</b>: Male Sprague-Dawley rats (3 weeks old, 110 ± 10 g) were allocated among four groups: normal diet (N), high-calorie diet (G), LPS-induced pneumonia (P), and high-calorie diet combined with lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced pneumonia (GP). LPS was administered via aerosolization for three days. Fecal, serum, and lung SCFA levels were quantified via GC-MS. Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) formation, neutrophil apoptosis, and HDAC activity were assessed using immunofluorescence, TUNEL assays, and qRT-PCR. Propionate supplementation and HDAC inhibitor (trichostatin A) interventions were applied to validate mechanistic pathways. <b>Results</b>: The group GP exhibited exacerbated lung inflammation, increased NETs release, and reduced neutrophil apoptosis compared to the group P. Propionate levels in feces, serum, and lung tissues decreased sharply in GP rats, correlating with elevated HDAC1/2/3/6 activity and reduced histone acetylation. Propionate supplementation or HDAC inhibition significantly attenuated lung injury, suppressed NETs, and restored neutrophil apoptosis. <b>Conclusions</b>: High-calorie diets exacerbate pneumonia by depleting gut-derived propionate, which drives HDAC-mediated NETs overproduction and impairs neutrophil apoptosis. Restoring propionate levels or targeting HDACs may offer therapeutic strategies for diet-aggravated respiratory diseases.

{"id": "rno03050", "name": "Proteasome - Rattus norvegicus (rat)", "description": "The proteasome is a protein-destroying apparatus involved in many essential cellular functions, such as regulation of cell cycle, cell differentiation, signal transduction pathways, antigen processing for appropriate immune responses, stress signaling, inflammatory responses, and apoptosis. It is capable of degrading a variety of cellular proteins in a rapid and timely fashion and most substrate proteins are modified by ubiquitin before their degradation by the proteasome. The proteasome is a large protein complex consisting of a proteolytic core called the 20S particle and ancillary factors that regulate its activity in various ways. The most common form is the 26S proteasome containing one 20S core particle and two 19S regulatory particles that enable the proteasome to degrade ubiquitinated proteins by an ATP-dependent mechanism. Another form is the immunoproteasome containing two 11S regulatory particles, PA28 alpha and PA28 beta, which are induced by interferon gamma under the conditions of intensified immune response. Other regulatory particles include PA28 gamma and PA200. Although PA28 gamma also belongs to a family of activators of the 20S proteasome, it is localized within the nucleus and forms a homoheptamer. PA28 gamma has been implicated in the regulation of cell cycle progression and apoptosis. PA200 has been identified as a large nuclear protein that stimulates proteasomal hydrolysis of peptides.", "genes": ["100360846"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "40450326", "title": "mTOR inhibition triggers mitochondrial fragmentation in cardiomyocytes through proteosome-dependent prohibitin degradation and OPA-1 cleavage.", "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Cardiac mitochondrial function is intricately regulated by various processes, ultimately impacting metabolic performance. Additionally, protein turnover is crucial for sustained metabolic homeostasis in cardiomyocytes. OBJECTIVE: Here, we studied the role of mTOR in OPA-1 cleavage and its consequent effects on mitochondrial dynamics and energetics in cardiomyocytes. RESULTS: Cultured rat cardiomyocytes treated with rapamycin for 6-24 h showed a significant reduction in phosphorylation of p70S6K, indicative of sustained inhibition of mTOR. Structural and functional analysis revealed increased mitochondrial fragmentation and impaired bioenergetics characterized by decreases in ROS production, oxygen consumption, and cellular ATP. Depletion of either the mitochondrial protease OMA1 or the mTOR regulator TSC2 by siRNA, coupled with an inducible, cardiomyocyte-specific knockout of mTOR in vivo, suggested that inhibition of mTOR promotes mitochondrial fragmentation through a mechanism involving OMA1 processing of OPA-1. Under homeostatic conditions, OMA1 activity is kept under check through an interaction with microdomains in the inner mitochondrial membrane that requires prohibitin proteins (PHB). Loss of these microdomains releases OMA1 to cleave its substrates. We found that rapamycin both increased ubiquitination of PHB1 and decreased its abundance, suggesting proteasomal degradation. Consistent with this, the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 maintained OPA-1 content in rapamycin-treated cardiomyocytes. Using pharmacological activation and inhibition of AMPK our data supports the hypothesis that this mTOR-PHB1-OMA-OPA-1 pathway impacts mitochondrial morphology under stress conditions, where it mediates dynamic changes in metabolic status. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that mTOR inhibition disrupts mitochondrial integrity in cardiomyocytes by promoting the degradation of prohibitins and OPA-1, leading to mitochondrial fragmentation and metabolic dysfunction, particularly under conditions of metabolic stress.", "authors": "Verdejo HE; Parra V; Del Campo A; Vasquez-Trincado C; Gatica D; Lopez-Crisosto C; Kuzmicic J; Venegas-Zamora L; Zuñiga-Cuevas U; Troncoso MF; Troncoso R; Rothermel BA; Chiong M; Abel ED; Lavandero S", "fulltext_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12125784/", "keywords": "Proteasome[MeSH Terms] AND rat[MeSH Terms]", "llm_relevance_assessment": {"relevance_score": 9, "relevance_level": "High", "species_check": "The pathway is in Rattus norvegicus (rat), and the study uses cultured rat cardiomyocytes, ensuring direct species alignment.", "evidence_summary": "We found that rapamycin both increased ubiquitination of PHB1 and decreased its abundance, suggesting proteasomal degradation.

This isozyme has a high preference for lipid hydroperoxides and protects cells against membrane lipid peroxidation and cell death. It is also required for normal sperm development; thus, it has been identified as a 'moonlighting' protein because of its ability to serve dual functions as a peroxidase, as well as a structural protein in mature spermatozoa. Disruption of this gene in mouse spermatocytes is associated with male infertility. This isozyme is also a selenoprotein, containing the rare amino acid selenocysteine (Sec) at its active site. Sec is encoded by the UGA codon, which normally signals translation termination. The 3' UTRs of selenoprotein mRNAs contain a conserved stem-loop structure, designated the Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element, that is necessary for the recognition of UGA as a Sec codon, rather than as a stop signal.

To our knowledge, it is unclear whether GAS has a therapeutic effect on Huntington's disease (HD). In the present study, we evaluated the effect of GAS on the degradation of mutant huntingtin protein (mHtt) by using PC12 cells transfected with N-terminal mHtt Q74. We found that 0.1-100 μM GAS had no effect on the survival rate of Q23 and Q74 PC12 cells after 24-48 h of incubation. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is the main system that clears misfolded proteins in eukaryotic cells. Mutated Htt significantly upregulated total ubiquitinated protein (Ub) expression, decreased chymotrypsin-like, trypsin-like and caspase-like peptidase activity, and reduced the colocalization of the 20S proteasome with mHtt. GAS (25 μM) attenuated all of the abovementioned pathological changes, and the regulatory effect of GAS on mHtt was found to be abolished by MG132, a proteasome inhibitor. The autophagy-lysosome pathway (ALP) is another system for misfolded protein degradation. Although GAS downregulated the expression of autophagy markers (LC3II and P62), it increased the colocalization of LC3II with lysosomal associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1), which indicates that ALP was activated. Moreover, GAS prevented mHtt-induced neuronal damage in PC12 cells. GAS has a selective effect on mHtt in Q74 PC12 cells and has no effect on Q23 and proteins encoded by other genes containing long CAGs, such as Rbm33 (10 CAG repeats) and Hcn1 (>30 CAG repeats). Furthermore, oral administration of 100 mg/kg GAS increased grip strength and attenuated mHtt aggregates in B6-hHTT130-N transgenic mice. This is a high dose (100 mg/kg GAS) when compared with experiments on HD mice with other small molecules.

This study aimed to evaluate the effect of different combinations of rTMS and cognitive training (rTMS-COG) on PSCI and identify the optimal combination protocol. A cerebral infarction rat model was established by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). The Morris water maze test was conducted to assess the cognitive function of rats. RNA sequencing and bioinformatics analysis were employed to study the underlying mechanisms. rTMS, COG and rTMS-COG all had beneficial effects on PSCI, while cognitive training immediately after rTMS (rTMS-COG<sub>0h</sub>) achieved a better effect than cognitive training 1 h and 4 h after rTMS, rTMS and COG. We identified 179 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 24 upregulated and 155 downregulated genes, between the rTMS-COG<sub>0h</sub> and rTMS groups. GO analysis revealed that the major categories associated with the DEGs were antigen procession and presentation, regulation of protein phosphorylation and axoneme assembly. KEGG analysis showed that the DEGs were enriched in processes related to phagosome, circadian entrainment, dopaminergic synapse, apelin signaling pathway, long-term depression, neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, axon guidance and glucagon signaling pathway.

"abstract": "BACKGROUND: SiNiSan (SNS) is an ancient Chinese herbal prescription, and the current clinical treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is effective. In the previous study of the research team, the multi-functional co-synergism of SNS against IBS was presented. Some potential drug targets and candidate ligands were predicted. PURPOSE: This study attempts to explore the crucial ingredient combinations from SNS formula and reveal their synergistic mechanism for IBS therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In present study, a comprehensive strategy was performed to reveal IBS related pathways and biological modules, and explore synergistic effects of the ingredients, including ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion) screening, Text mining, Venn analysis, Gene ontology (GO) analysis, Pathway cluster analysis, Molecular docking, Network construction and Experimental verification in visceral hypersensitivity (VHS) rats. RESULTS: Three compressed IBS signal pathways were derived from ClueGO KEGG analysis of 63 IBS genes, including Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, Inflammatory mediator regulation of TRP (transient receptor potential) channels and Serotonergic synapse. A multi-module network, composed of four IBS therapeutic modules (psychological, inflammation, neuroendocrine and cross-talk modules), was revealed by Target-Pathway network. Nine kernel targets were considered closely associated with the IBS pathways, including ADRA2A, HTR2A, F2RL1, F2RL3, TRPV1, PKC, PKA, IL-1Β and NGF. In silico analysis revealed that three crucial ingredients (synephrine, paeoniflorin and naringin) were assumed to coordinate the network of those IBS therapeutic modules by acting on these kernel targets in the important pathways. In vivo experimental results showed that the crucial ingredient combinations synergistically affected the expressions of the kernel biological molecules, and improved the minimum capacity threshold of AWR in VHS rats. CONCLUSION: The study proposes the important IBS associated pathways and the network regulation mechanisms of the crucial ingredients.

"abstract": "ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Zhizhu Xiang (ZZX for short) is the root and rhizome of Valeriana jatamansi Jones, which is a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) used to treat various mood disorders for more than 2000 years, especially anxiety. However, there have been few investigations to clarify the compounds in ZZX for the treatment of anxiety. AIM OF THE STUDY: Our previous study has identified five anti-anxiety components, including hesperidin, isochlorogenic acid A, isochlorogenic acid B and isochlorogenic acid C and chlorogenic acid, from extract of ZZX. In order to find the optimal combination and the underlying mechanism of these five components in the treatment of anxiety disorder, researches were designed based on uniform design method and proteomic technology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The samples with different proportion and content of the five active components were arranged by uniform design method. Then a mathematical model was formulated using partial least square method and stepwise regression analysis. Moreover, the empty bottle stress-induced anxiety rat model was established, and the anti-anxiety effect was recorded by the unconditioned reflex elevated maze test and the open field test. In addition, the isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) technique, along with the multidimensional liquid chromatography and high-resolution mass spectrometry were applied in proteomic study. At last, the result of proteomic analysis was further confirmed by Western blot. RESULTS: The optimal combination of the components from the extract of ZZX was 1.153 mg/kg hesperidin, 2.197 mg/kg Isochlorogenic acid A, 0.699 mg/kg Isochlorogenic acid B and 1.249 mg/kg Chlorogenic acid. Total 6818 proteins were identified using proteomic analysis and 80 differentially expressed proteins were used for further bioinformatic analysis. These proteins were involved in the neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, protein digestion and absorption, cholesterol metabolism, Chagas disease, and AGE/RAGE signaling pathway. CONCLUSIONS: The composition and proportion of anti-anxiety components in extract of ZZX was disclosed, and there was an anti-anxiety effect for the combined components of flavonoids and phenolic acids. Through proteomic analysis and Western blot, it was found that the effective components of extract of ZZX can exert synergistic anti-anxiety effects via the regulation of multi-signaling pathways.

due to its complex symptoms, high incidence and long duration. At present, the exact pathogenesis of NP is still unclear. In this study, we sought to identify the genes as well as the related molecular mechanisms associated with NP occurrence and development. METHODS: We firstly identified the differentially expressed genes between NP spinal nerve ligation (SNL) rats and control sham rats and then projected them onto a STRING network for functional association analysis. Then, random walk with restart (RWR) was conducted to find some new NP-related genes, with their potential functions sequentially analyzed by GO annotation and KEGG pathway analysis. RESULTS: Some new NP-related genes, like Gng13, C3 and Cxcl2, were identified by RWR analysis. Meanwhile, some biological functions like inflammatory responses, chemotaxis and immune responses, as well as some signaling pathways, such as those involved in neuroactive ligand-receptor interactions, complement and blood coagulation cascade reactions, and cytokine-receptor interactions that the new NP-related genes were most activated were found to be associated with NP occurrence and development.

Modern pharmacological research showed that NTF has a good anti-cerebral ischemic effect and can improve the learning and memory ability of cerebrovascular disease. AIM: The purpose of this study is to explore the regulation mechanism of NTF on the regulation mechanism of vascular dementia (VD)'s biological network based on chemoinformatics and transcriptomics strategies. METHOD: First, the bilateral common carotid artery ligation method was used to create a rat VD model. After NTF intervention for 30 days, the treatment effect was evaluated by HE staining and water maze experiment. Then, the Agilent mRNA expression profiling chip was used to obtain mRNA expression data of hippocampal tissues of VD model rats before and after NTF intervention, and microarray analysis was used to screen for genes with significant differential expression. The BATMAN database was utilized to obtain the potential targets of NTF and the Genecards and OMIM were utilized to collect the VD potential genes. The cytoscape was utilized to construct and analyze the networks. RESULT: The animal experiments showed that NTF can improve VD. A total of 180 up-regulated proteins and 289 down-regulated proteins were identified. The top 20 up- and down-regulated differentially expressed genes were utilized to construct differentially expressed gene's protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. A total of 677 NTF potential targets and 550 VD genes were obtained and were utilized to construct NTF-VD PPI network. The cheminformatics analysis showed that NTF can regulate a lot of biological processes and signaling pathways (such as inflammation modules, vasodilation and contraction modules, hypoxia modules, angiogenesis, coagulation, neurovascular unit modules, Neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, Calcium signaling pathway, Serotonergic synapse).

In the present study, Wistar rats were treated by gavage with PCB52 (1 mg/kg body weight) or corn oil from gestational day 7 to postnatal day 21. Both the body lengths and weights of the suckling rats at birth were significantly decreased by PCB52 treatment, suggesting developmental toxicity. Although no obvious histopathological changes were observed in the brain, using RNA-sequencing, 208 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the striatum of PCB52-treated male offspring, while just 13 DEGs were identified in female offspring, suggesting sex-specific effects. Furthermore, using Gene Ontology enrichment analysis, neurodevelopmental processes, neurobehavioral alterations, and neurotransmission changes were enriched from the 208 DEGs in male offspring. Similarly, using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis, neuroactive ligand receptor interactions and multiple synapse pathways were enriched in male offspring, implying dysfunction of the neurotransmission system.

This research aims to characterize the effect of α-Syn knockdown on transcriptional levels after SCI and to determine the mechanisms underlying α-Syn activity based on RNA-seq. RESULT: The establishment of a rat model of lentiviral vector-mediated knockdown of α-Syn in Sprague-Dawley rats with T3 spinal cord contusion (LV_SCI group). The results of the RNA-seq analysis showed that there were 337 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the SCI group and the LV_SCI group, and 153 DEGs specific to LV_SCI between the (SCI vs LV_SCI) and (SCI vs CON) comparisons. The top 20 biological transition terms were identified by Gene ontology (GO) analysis. The Kyoto Gene and Genomic Encyclopedia (KEGG) analysis showed that the LV_SCI group significantly upregulated the cholinergic synaptic & nicotine addiction and the neuroactive ligand receptor interaction signaling pathway. Enriched chord analysis analyzes key genes. Further cluster analysis, gene and protein interaction network analysis and RT-qPCR results showed that Chrm2 and Chrnb2 together significantly in both pathways. The proliferation of muscarinic cholinergic receptor subtype 2 (Chrm2) and nicotinic cholinergic receptor subtype β2 (Chrnb2), and the neurogenesis were elevated in the injury site of LV_SCI group by immunofluorescence. Further by subcellular localization, the LV_SCI group enhanced the expression of Chrnb2 at the cell membrane.

Activated TNF is assembled to a homotrimer and binds to its receptors (TNFR1, TNFR2) resulting in the trimerization of TNFR1 or TNFR2. TNFR1 is expressed by nearly all cells and is the major receptor for TNF (also called TNF-alpha). In contrast, TNFR2 is expressed in limited cells such as CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes, endothelial cells, microglia, oligodendrocytes, neuron subtypes, cardiac myocytes, thymocytes and human mesenchymal stem cells. It is the receptor for both TNF and LTA (also called TNF-beta). Upon binding of the ligand, TNFR mediates the association of some adaptor proteins such as TRADD or TRAF2, which in turn initiate recruitment of signal transducers. TNFR1 signaling induces activation of many genes, primarily controlled by two distinct pathways, NF-kappa B pathway and the MAPK cascade, or apoptosis and necroptosis. TNFR2 signaling activates NF-kappa B pathway including PI3K-dependent NF-kappa B pathway and JNK pathway leading to survival.", "genes": ["114105"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "41302395", "title": "<i>Momordica charantia</i> L.

The family of endocannabinoids includes at least five derivatives of arachidonic acid; the two best characterized are arachydonoyl ethanolamide (anandamide, AEA) and 2-arachydonoil glycerol (2AG). They are released from postsynaptic neurons upon postsynaptic depolarization and/or receptor activation. The released endocannabinoids then activate the CB1 receptors (CB1R) at presynaptic terminals and suppress the release of inhibitory transmitter GABA (depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition, DSI) or excitatory transmitter glutamate (depolarization-induced suppression of excitation, DSE) by inhibiting Ca2+ channels. Besides the well-known expression of the CB1R in the plasma membrane, this receptor is also present in mitochondrial membranes, where it reduces the mitochondrial respiration and contributes to DSI. Whereas DSI and DSE result in short-term synaptic plasticity, endocannabinoids also mediate long-term synaptic changes (eCB-LTD). Persistent activation of CB1 receptors over a period of minutes triggers eCB-LTD by a RIM1alpha-dependent mechanism.", "genes": ["100361934"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "29511121", "title": "A role for corticotropin-releasing factor signaling in the lateral habenula and its modulation by early-life stress.", "abstract": "Centrally released corticotropin-releasing factor or hormone (extrahypothalamic CRF or CRH) in the brain is involved in the behavioral and emotional responses to stress. The lateral habenula (LHb) is an epithalamic brain region involved in value-based decision-making and stress evasion. Through its inhibition of dopamine-mediated reward circuitry, the increased activity of the LHb is associated with addiction, depression, schizophrenia, and behavioral disorders. We found that extrahypothalamic CRF neurotransmission increased neuronal excitability in the LHb. Through its receptor CRFR1 and subsequently protein kinase A (PKA), CRF application increased the intrinsic excitability of LHb neurons by affecting changes in small-conductance SK-type and large-conductance BK-type K<sup>+</sup> channels. CRF also reduced inhibitory γ-aminobutyric acid-containing (GABAergic) synaptic transmission onto LHb neurons through endocannabinoid-mediated retrograde signaling. Maternal deprivation is a severe early-life stress that alters CRF neural circuitry and is likewise associated with abnormal mental health later in life. LHb neurons from pups deprived of maternal care exhibited increased intrinsic excitability, reduced GABAergic transmission, decreased abundance of SK2 channel protein, and increased activity of PKA, without any substantial changes in <i>Crh</i> or <i>Crhr1</i> expression. Furthermore, maternal deprivation blunted the response of LHb neurons to subsequent, acute CRF exposure.

Also humans are affected by the seasons with regard to immune responses and mental functions, the seasonal affective disorder being one of the most prominent examples. The hypophysial pars tuberalis (PT), an important interface between the hypophysial pars distalis and neuroendocrine centers in the brain, plays an essential role in the regulation of seasonal functions and may even be the seat of the circannual clock. Photoperiodic signals provide a major input to the PT. While the perception of these signals involves extraocular photoreceptors in non-mammalian species (birds, fish), mammals perceive photoperiodic signals exclusively in the retina. A multisynaptic pathway connects the retina with the pineal organ where photoperiodic signals are translated into the neurohormone melatonin that is rhythmically produced night by night and encodes the length of the night. Melatonin controls the functional activity of the mammalian PT by acting upon MT1 melatonin receptors. The PT sends its output signals via retrograde and anterograde pathways. The retrograde pathway targetting the hypothalamus employs TSH as messenger and controls a local hypothalamic T3 system. As discovered in Japanese quail, TSH triggers molecular cascades mediating thyroid hormone conversion in the ependymal cell layer of the infundibular recess of the third ventricle. The local accumulation of T<sub>3</sub> in the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) appears to activate the gonadal axis by affecting the neuro-glial interaction between GnRH terminals and tanycytes in the median eminence. This retrograde pathway is conserved in photoperiodic mammals (sheep and hamsters), and even in non-photoperiodic laboratory mice provided that they are capable to synthesize melatonin. The anterograde pathway is implicated in the control of prolactin secretion, targets cells in the PD and supposedly employs small molecules as signal substances collectively denominated as \"tuberalins\". Several \"tuberalin\" candidates have been proposed, such as tachykinins, the secretory protein TAFA and endocannabinoids (EC). The PT-intrinsic EC system was first demonstrated in Syrian hamsters and shown to respond to photoperiodic changes. Subsequently, the EC system was also demonstrated in the PT of mice, rats and humans. To date, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) appears as the most important endocannabinoid from the PT. Likely targets for the EC are folliculo-stellate cells that contain the CB1 receptor and appear to contact lactotroph cells. The CB1 receptor was also found on corticotroph cells which appear as a further target of the EC. Recently, the CB1 receptor was also localized to CRF-containing nerve fibers running in the outer zone of the median eminence. This finding suggests that the EC system of the PT contributes not only to the anterograde, but also to the retrograde pathway. Taken together, the results support the concept that the PT transmits its signals via a \"cocktail\" of messenger molecules which operate also in other brain areas and systems rather than through PT-specific \"tuberalins\". Furthermore, they may attribute a novel function to the PT, namely the modulation of the stress response and immune functions.", "authors": "Korf HW", "fulltext_url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ygcen.2017.05.011", "keywords": "Retrograde endocannabinoid signaling[MeSH Terms] AND rat[MeSH Terms]", "llm_relevance_assessment": {"relevance_score": 8, "relevance_level": "High", "species_check": "The pathway is in rat (Rattus norvegicus), and the article discusses the endocannabinoid system in the rat pars tuberalis, confirming species alignment.", "evidence_summary": "The PT-intrinsic EC system was first demonstrated in Syrian hamsters and shown to respond to photoperiodic changes.

PKA modulates, via phosphorylation, a number of cellular substrates, including transcription factors, ion channels, transporters, exchangers, intracellular Ca2+ -handling proteins, and the contractile machinery.

This study investigated the therapeutic potential of Urocortin 2 (UCN2) for promoting neurofunctional recovery. In a rat model of T10 spinal cord transection, daily intraperitoneal UCN2 treatment, initiated two days post-injury, significantly improved hindlimb motor function by day 14. We found that the UCN2 receptor, CRHR2, is expressed in neurons, astrocytes, and microglia. In vivo, UCN2 administration reduced neuronal apoptosis and neurofilament damage, suppressed microglial activation, and promoted the conversion of neurotoxic A1 astrocytes to a regenerative A2 phenotype. These beneficial effects were mediated by the activation of the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway, evidenced by the upregulation of PKA, CREB, and Bcl-2, and downregulation of NF-κB, RhoA, and Bax. Complementary in vitro experiments confirmed that UCN2 directly promotes axonal regeneration, inhibits neuronal apoptosis, enhances the secretion of GDNF from astrocytes, and suppresses the inflammatory NF-κB pathway in microglia.

The research explores the influence of conjunctival stem cells (CjSCs) by blue light, elucidating the pathogenesis of blue light-induced dry eye.

The impact of blue light illumination on both CjSCs and rats was examined, and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) identified the specific mechanisms. Additionally, blue light-irradiated rats and primary CjSCs were treated with Forskolin to validate the effects of the cAMP-PKA pathway on CjSCs differentiation and blue light-induced dry eye. RESULTS: Blue light exposure not only affected the stemness and proliferation of CjSCs, but also disturbed the differentiation by down-regulating the expression of Pax6. Mechanically, the cAMP-PKA signaling pathway was significantly inhibited following blue light emission. Reduced P-PKA expression affected Pax6 transcription, which in turn promoted abnormal differentiation of CjSCs. Moreover, Forskolin, a specific agonist of cAMP-PKA, effectively rescued the drawback of blue light irradiation on CjSCs.

They couple ATP hydrolysis to active transport of a wide variety of substrates such as ions, sugars, lipids, sterols, peptides, proteins, and drugs. The structure of a prokaryotic ABC transporter usually consists of three components; typically two integral membrane proteins each having six transmembrane segments, two peripheral proteins that bind and hydrolyze ATP, and a periplasmic (or lipoprotein) substrate-binding protein. Many of the genes for the three components form operons as in fact observed in many bacterial and archaeal genomes.

Previous studies have shown that rosmarinic acid (RA) has a good effect in lowering uric acid (UA). However, the exact mechanism of RA in treating HUA is still not fully understood. PURPOSE: To validate the therapeutic effect of RA on HUA and its potential pharmacological mechanisms through a comprehensive analysis of the gut microbiome, metabolomics and molecular interaction techniques. METHODS: A rat model of HUA was replicated with 10 % fructose water. The therapeutic effect of RA on HUA rats for 28 consecutive days was assessed through histopathology and biochemical analyses. Additionally, 16S rDNA sequencing, metabolomics, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulation (MDS), surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and microScale thermophoresis (MST) were used to investigate the mechanisms of RA for HUA treatment. RESULTS: RA could significantly reduce uric acid (UA) levels, inhibit the activities of UA synthase xanthine oxidase (XOD) and adenosine deaminase (ADA), and improve the function of intestinal and renal tissues. Furthermore, RA altered the composition of the gut microbiota in rats by reducing the Firmicutes to Bacteroidota ratio and increasing the abundance of Bacteroides at the genus level. RA could influence the levels of XOD, ADA, and other plasma metabolites. Importantly, RA modulated ABCG2 expression in the intestine and kidney, as well as URAT1 expression in the kidney. MDS proved that RA bound tightly to these transporters, the SRP results indicated that the equilibrium dissociation constants of RA with GLUT9 is 6.20 μM, RA with URAT1 is 667 nM respectively, and the MST results indicated that the equilibrium dissociation constants of RA and ABCG2 is 264.6 nM. CONCLUSION: RA can promote UA excretion by regulating the imbalance of gut microbiota and the expressions of URAT1, GLUT9 and ABCGT2 in HUA rats. This study, for the first time, combined gut microbiota, metabolomics and molecular interaction techniques to verify the intrinsic molecular mechanism of RA in the treatment of HUA, providing a basis for the development of UA-lowering drugs.", "authors": "Jia L; Sun B; Nie A; Shi Y; Zhou Z; Zhu C", "fulltext_url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phymed.2025.157084", "keywords": "ABC transporters[MeSH Terms] AND rat[MeSH Terms]", "llm_relevance_assessment": {"relevance_score": 8, "relevance_level": "High", "species_check": "The pathway is in rat (Rattus norvegicus), and the study uses a rat model of hyperuricemia, ensuring species consistency.", "evidence_summary": "RA modulated ABCG2 expression in the intestine and kidney...

This study investigates the role of the ATP-binding cassette sub-family G member 2 (ABCG2) transporter and the lncRNA H19/miR-21-3p in renal urate deposition, while also validating the therapeutic effects and mechanisms of chicory extract. Renal urate deposition was induced in rats through the administration of potassium oxonate, adenine, yeast extract, and lipopolysaccharide. The levels of serum uric acid (SUA), urate deposition, inflammation, renal function, and histological changes were analyzed. Dual-luciferase assays, reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR), and immunohistochemistry were utilized to elucidate the relationship among ABCG2, lncRNA H19, and miR-21-3p. The chemical composition and active ingredients of chicory were analyzed using UPLC-LTQ-Orbitrap-MS, along with molecular docking and cell experiments. In rats with renal urate deposition, serum UA levels were elevated, renal UA excretion was reduced, and levels of low inflammatory factors, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and hypersensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), were increased. Additionally, significant renal tissue damage accompanied the urate deposition. Notably, these abnormalities were substantially reversed following treatment with chicory extract. A dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed the regulatory relationships among miR-21-3p, lncRNA H19, and ABCG2. Immunohistochemical analysis and RT-qPCR demonstrated a significant upregulation of miR-21-3p expression, alongside a downregulation of lncRNA H19, <i>ABCG2</i> mRNA, and ABCG2 expression in the kidney tissue of rats with renal urate deposition. Chicory extract may exert its inhibitory effect on renal urate deposition by regulating the lncRNA H19/miR-21-3p axis to enhance ABCG2 expression.

excretion to mitigate nephrotoxicity. However, the mechanisms underlying cadmium excretion from the kidneys remain unclear. The role of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter family in the renal excretion of cadmium was investigated in this study. We employed gene chip technology to identify alterations in gene and protein expression within the ABC transporter family, particularly focusing on ABCC1, in response to cadmium exposure. Utilizing CRISPR-Cas9 technology, we created NRK cells that overexpress ABCC1 (LV-OE), and observed that the overexpression of ABCC1 accelerated cadmium efflux in these cells. Conversely, the application of an ABCC1 inhibitor (MK571) to NRK cells suppressed ABCC1 expression and delayed cadmium efflux. Molecular docking studies, informed by computer-aided drug design, indicated that glutathione (GSH) exhibits a superior binding affinity to the ABCC1 protein structure. Furthermore, the addition of GSH enhanced cadmium efflux from renal tissue and NRK cells, suggesting that cadmium efflux may be mediated by the ABCC1 protein.

The aim of this study is to enhance the absorption of Pue and improve therapeutic efficacy by adding cinnamaldehyde (CA). The pharmacokinetics of Pue in rats were studied using oral administration: CA + Pue, and single Pue. The Caco-2 cell model was used to investigate the effect of CA on the absorption and transport of Pue. The absorption sensitivity of TSG to P-gp inhibitors verapamil (Ver), Ko143, and MK-571 in vivo were simultaneously evaluated, and assessed the effects of ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter inhibitors (such as P-gp inhibitors verapamil, MK-571, and BCRP inhibitor Ko143) on predicting targeted transport of active ingredients to explore the relationship between Pue transport and inhibition of these efflux proteins. A rat model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) was established to explore the therapeutic effect of single Pue and Pue with CA on ischemic stroke (IS). The results showed that compared with Pue suspension, CA increased the absorption of Pue in rats, with C<sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>(0-t)</sub> being 4.84 times and 11.54 times higher, respectively. Both P-gp and MRP play a role in the transport mechanism of Pue. Compared with single Pue, the transmembrane transport from Basolateral (BL) to Apical (AP) side of Pue was significantly reduced when Pue was applied in combination with CA. In addition, the efflux ratio (ER) value also significantly decreased. This discovery suggests that CA may reduce the secretion of Pue, thereby enhancing its absorption and transport by inhibiting exocytosis mediated by efflux transporters, similar to the effect of Ver. On the other hand, in the MCAO rat model, Pue + CA reduced the extent of cerebral infarction, alleviated pathological damage, significantly reduced the level of inflammatory mediators, and increased the release of anti-inflammatory factors, suggesting that CA can synergize with Pue to exert a better therapeutic effect on IS.

{"id": "rno04520", "name": "Adherens junction - Rattus norvegicus (rat)", "description": "Cell-cell adherens junctions (AJs), the most common type of intercellular adhesions, are important for maintaining tissue architecture and cell polarity and can limit cell movement and proliferation. At AJs, E-cadherin serves as an essential cell adhesion molecules (CAMs). The cytoplasmic tail binds beta-catenin, which in turn binds alpha-catenin. Alpha-catenin is associated with F-actin bundles directly and indirectly. The integrity of the cadherin-catenin complex is negatively regulated by phosphorylation of beta-catenin by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases (Fer, Fyn, Yes, and Src), which leads to dissociation of the cadherin-catenin complex. Integrity of this complex is positively regulated by beta -catenin phosphorylation by casein kinase II, and dephosphorylation by protein tyrosine phosphatases. Changes in the phosphorylation state of beta-catenin affect cell-cell adhesion, cell migration and the level of signaling beta-catenin. Wnt signaling acts as a positive regulator of beta-catenin by inhibiting beta-catenin degradation, which stabilizes beta-catenin, and causes its accumulation. Cadherin may acts as a negative regulator of signaling beta-catenin as it binds beta-catenin at the cell surface and thereby sequesters it from the nucleus. Nectins also function as CAMs at AJs, but are more highly concentrated at AJs than E-cadherin. Nectins transduce signals through Cdc42 and Rac, which reorganize the actin cytoskeleton, regulate the formation of AJs, and strengthen cell-cell adhesion.", "genes": ["100361457"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "34535732", "title": "IIIG9 inhibition in adult ependymal cells changes adherens junctions structure and induces cellular detachment.", "abstract": "Ependymal cells have multiple apical cilia that line the ventricular surfaces and the central canal of spinal cord. In cancer, the loss of ependymal cell polarity promotes the formation of different types of tumors, such as supratentorial anaplastic ependymomas, which are highly aggressive in children. IIIG9 (PPP1R32) is a protein restricted to adult ependymal cells located in cilia and in the apical cytoplasm and has unknown function. In this work, we studied the expression and localization of IIIG9 in the adherens junctions (cadherin/β-catenin-positive junctions) of adult brain ependymal cells using confocal and transmission electron microscopy. Through in vivo loss-of-function studies, ependymal denudation (single-dose injection experiments of inhibitory adenovirus) was observed, inducing the formation of ependymal cells with a \"balloon-like\" morphology. These cells had reduced cadherin expression (and/or delocalization) and cleavage of the cell death marker caspase-3, with \"cilia rigidity\" morphology (probably vibrational beating activity) and ventriculomegaly occurring prior to these events. Finally, after performing continuous infusions of adenovirus for 14 days, we observed total cell denudation and reactive parenchymal astrogliosis.

resident mesenchymal cells in the space of Disse interposed between liver sinusoidal endothelial cells and hepatocytes. Thorn-like microprojections, or spines, project out from the cell surface of HSCs, crossing the space of Disse, to establish adherens junctions with neighboring hepatocytes. Although HSC activation is initiated largely from stimulation by adjacent cells, isolated HSCs also activate spontaneously in primary culture on plastic. Therefore, other unknown HSC-initiating factors apart from paracrine stimuli may promote activation. The dissociation of adherens junctions between HSCs and hepatocytes as an activating signal for HSCs was explored, establishing epithelial cadherin (E-cadherin) as an adhesion molecule linking hepatocytes and HSCs. In vivo, following carbon tetrachloride-induced liver injury, HSCs lost their spines and dissociated from adherens junctions in the early stages of injury, and were subsequently activated along with an increase in YAP/TAZ expression. After abrogation of liver injury, HSCs reconstructed their spines and adherens junctions. In vitro, reconstitution of E-cadherin-containing adherens junctions by forced E-cadherin expression quiesced HSCs and suppressed TAZ expression. Additionally, increase of TAZ expression leading to the activation of HSCs by autocrine stimulation of transforming growth factor-β, was revealed as a mechanism of spontaneous activation.

Although volatile anaesthetics, such as sevoflurane, have demonstrated protective properties in many organs, their use in cerebral injury is controversial. Cerebral vasodilation may lead to increased intracranial pressure (ICP), but at the same time volatile anaesthetics are known to stabilise the SAH-injured endothelial barrier. OBJECTIVE: To test the effect of sevoflurane on ICP and blood-brain barrier function. DESIGN: Randomised study. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred male Wistar rats included, 96 analysed. INTERVENTIONS: SAH was induced by the endoluminal filament method under ketamine/xylazine anaesthesia. Fifteen minutes after sham surgery or induction of SAH, adult male Wistar rats were randomised to 4 h sedation with either propofol or sevoflurane. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mean arterial pressure (MAP), ICP, extravasation of water (small), Evan's blue (intermediate) and IgG (large molecule) were measured. Zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) and beta-catenin (β-catenin), as important representatives of tight and adherens junction proteins, were determined by western blot. RESULTS: Propofol and sevoflurane sedation did not affect MAP or ICP in SAH animals. Extravasation of small molecules was higher in SAH-propofol compared with SAH-sevoflurane animals (79.1 ± 0.9 vs. 78.0 ± 0.7%, P = 0.04). For intermediate and large molecules, no difference was detected (P = 0.6 and P = 0.2). Both membrane and cytosolic fractions of ZO-1 as well as membrane β-catenin remained unaffected by the injury and type of sedation. Decreased cytosolic fraction of β-catenin in propofol-SAH animals (59 ± 15%) was found to reach values of sham animals (100%) in the presence of sevoflurane in SAH animals (89 ± 21%; P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: This experiment demonstrates that low-dose short-term sevoflurane sedation after SAH in vivo did not affect ICP and MAP and at the same time may attenuate early brain oedema formation, potentially by preserving adherens junctions.

Orthokeratinized odontogenic cysts expressed keratin 1, keratin 2, keratin 10, and loricrin, suggesting differentiation toward normal epidermis. Keratocystic odontogenic tumors expressed keratin 4, keratin 13, keratin 17, and keratin 19, which is a unique expression pattern reminiscent of a mucosal squamous epithelium and an epithelial appendage. In neonatal rat tooth germ, cells strongly positive for keratin 17 and keratin 19 were observed, specifically in the dental lamina, implying the origin of keratocystic odontogenic tumor. GLI2, a downstream effector of hedgehog signaling, was significantly expressed in keratocystic odontogenic tumor and basal cell carcinoma, accompanied with robust expression of keratin 17, mammalian target of rapamycin, and BCL2. The expression of these GLI2- or keratin 17-related factors was not significantly observed in orthokeratinized odontogenic cysts.

We present data showing unique SHH mutations in BCCs from repair-deficient, skin cancer-prone xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) patients, which are characterized by high levels of UV-specific mutations in key genes involved in skin carcinogenesis, including PATCHED and SMOOTHENED. Thus, 6 UV-specific SHH mutations were detected in 5 of 33 XP BCCs. These missense SHH alterations are not activating mutations for its postulated proto-oncogene function, as the mutant SHH proteins do not show transforming activity and induce differentiation or stimulate proliferation to the same level as the wild-type protein. Structural modeling studies of the 4 proteins altered at the surface residues, G57S, G64K, D147N, and R155C, show that they do not effect the protein conformation. Interestingly, they are all located on one face of the compact SHH protein suggesting that they may have altered affinity for different partners, which may be important in altering other functions. Additional functional analysis of the SHH mutations found in vivo in XP BCCs will help shed light on the role of SHH in skin carcinogenesis.

More evidence suggests a high potential correlation between vitamin D deficiency and depression. However, the underlying mechanisms and the therapeutic potential of vitamin D supplementation are still not properly understood. The purpose of this research is to evaluate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on depressive behaviors using a rat model of depression and explore the potential mechanisms involved. Depression is a prevalent mental health disorder that significantly impacts the quality of life of individuals. Despite the availability of various treatment options, many patients still experience suboptimal outcomes, highlighting the need for further exploration of novel therapeutic approaches. In recent years, the importance of vitamin D in mental health, particularly in depression, has gained considerable attention. METHODS: In this project, we propose to utilize an animal model of depressed rats to evaluate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on depressive behaviors. We employed a range of well-established behavioral tests to assess changes in depressive-like behaviors following vitamin D supplementation. Additionally, histopathological examinations of the hippocampal region, known to be involved in mood regulation, were performed to assess structural alterations and cellular changes associated with depression and vitamin D supplementation.

Locomotor activity and anxiety levels were evaluated via the elevated plus maze, and learning/memory performance were tested using the Morris water maze probe test. Reserpine exposure led to increased mechanical allodynia, decreased locomotor activity, elevated anxiety levels, increased depressive-like behavior, and impaired learning/memory (p < 0.05).

Despite available treatments, their limited efficacy, inability to promote remyelination, and associated adverse reactions highlight the need for unconventional therapies. This study investigated the therapeutic potential of dexmedetomidine (DEX), a selective α2-adrenergic receptor (α2AR) agonist, in a rat model of MS triggered by experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). EAE was induced in male Sprague Dawley rats using guinea pig spinal cord homogenate and complete Freund's adjuvant, replicating MS-like pathology. DEX (10 μg/kg/day, i.p.) was administered for 14 days, significantly improved motor function and muscle coordination, as shown by enhanced performance in the open field, rotarod, and hanging wire tests, along with reduced pain sensitivity in the Randall-Selitto test. Histological analyses (H&E and TEM) confirmed increased axonal remyelination and paralleling improvements in clinical scores. Mechanistically, DEX activated α2AR, stimulating the PI3K/p-Akt pathway and promoting CREB phosphorylation. This cascade upregulated BDNF and TrkB gene expression and enhanced neuronal remyelination and survival. Additionally, DEX exhibited potent anti-inflammatory effects by suppressing HMGB1, thereby downregulating TLR4 expression and inhibiting the pS536-NF-κB p65/TNF-α axis. This shift was evidenced by reduced CD86 immunoreactivity and increased CD163 expression, indicating a transition toward an anti-inflammatory phenotype. In conclusion, DEX exerts neuroprotective effects in EAE-induced MS by simultaneously triggering the PI3K/Akt/CREB/BDNF/TrkB pathway and hindering the HMGB1/TLR4/NF-κB/TNF-α cascade, leading to reduced neuroinflammation and enhanced remyelination.

caused by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) in rats. This study explores how acupuncture improves depressive behaviors by modulating synaptic plasticity in the lateral habenula through stimulation of Fengfu and Shangxing acupoints. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into six groups, with the control group excluded. Undergoing a 28-day CUMS protocol, the intervention groups included sham needle stimulation, daily stimulation at the Fengfu (GV16) and Shangxing (GV23) acupoints on alternate days, fluoxetine (2.1 mg/kg, 0.21 mg/mL), or electroacupuncture treatment. All rats were weighed and subjected to behavioral tests. Western blotting was used to examine the expression of the BDNF/ERK/mTOR signaling pathway and associated proteins in the lateral habenula. The monoamine neurotransmitters in serum were measured using ELISA kits. Immunofluorescence staining was used to determine the expression levels of BDNF, TrkB, SYP, and PSD95 in the lateral habenula. Golgi staining was employed to quantify dendritic spine morphology. The study showed that CUMS led to depressive-like behaviors and downregulated the BDNF/ERK/mTOR signaling pathway in the lateral habenula. It also resulted in reduced expression of monoamine neurotransmitters in peripheral blood and changes in dendritic spine length and density. Importantly, both fluoxetine and acupuncture had varying degrees of preventive and restorative effects on these changes.

This study aimed to explore cubebin's potential neuroprotective effects against METH-induced cognitive deficits by investigating its ability to suppress lipid peroxidation and pro-inflammatory markers and modulate neurotransmitter levels. <i>Material and Methods:</i> A total of 30 rats were taken and randomly grouped into five groups: group I-control; group II-METH 100 mg/kg/i.p.; group III-METH + cubebin (10 mg/kg/p.o.); group IV-METH + cubebin (20 mg/kg/p.o.); and group V-cubebin per os at 20 mg/kg.

Our findings demonstrate that maternal SCH induces significant behavioral abnormalities in the offspring, including increased grooming behavior and deficits in social interaction, which are hallmarks of autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

These molecular changes are consistent with disrupted synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis, which are critical processes for cognitive and social development. Our study further reveals that impaired Wnt/BDNF signaling may play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of autism-like behaviors in these offspring.

following central nervous system (CNS) injury or in neurodegenerative disorders. Therefore, clearing these harmful components and establishing a regeneration-permissive microenvironment are crucial for functional recovery. In this study, primary olfactory ensheathing cells (OECs) isolated from adult SD rats were pharmacologically treated with fisetin, a pharmacological agent. To model CNS injury conditions, neural debris was generated through mechanical disruption of primary neural cells. Neurons exposed to this hostile environment were then treated with conditioned medium from fisetin-activated OECs. Subsequent assessments using qRT-PCR, Western blot, CCK-8 assays, immunofluorescence, and ELISA revealed that fisetin significantly enhanced OEC activation, increasing proliferation and viability. Critically, fisetin-treated OECs markedly mitigated debris-induced neurotoxicity, thereby promoting neuronal survival and neurite outgrowth, which was associated with the upregulated anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-10, TGF-β) and neurotrophic factors (BDNF, GDNF, NGF). Mechanistically, fisetin-activated OECs facilitated neuronal growth via the PI3K/Akt/CREB pathway, suggesting that fisetin potentiates OEC-mediated neuroprotection and neurite regeneration in degenerative environments.

In vitro, it enhances glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in β-cell lines and rodent islets. While lysine is thought to act via membrane depolarization similar to arginine, the role of its intracellular metabolism in β-cell function remains unexplored. Here, we show that lysine acutely potentiates GSIS and that genes encoding enzymes in the lysine degradation pathway, including AminoAdipate-Semialdehyde Synthase (AASS), a key mitochondrial enzyme catalysing the first two steps of lysine catabolism, were present in human pancreatic islets and INS1 832/13 β cells. Some of these genes including AASS, ALDH7A1, DHTKD1, and HADH, were downregulated in pancreatic islets from type 2 diabetes (T2D) versus non-diabetic (ND) donors. Silencing AASS in human islets and INS1 832/13 β cells led to reduced GSIS. Integrated transcriptomics and metabolomics revealed altered expression of GABA metabolism genes, reduced GABA content and accumulation of glutamate in Aass-KD cells. Mitochondrial TCA cycle and OXPHOS function was impaired, evidenced by decreased ATP/ADP ratio, diminished glucose-stimulated mitochondrial respiration, and elevated lactate/pyruvate ratio. Cytosolic calcium responses to glucose and GABA were also disrupted. Pharmacological analyses demonstrated that inhibition of GABA synthesis or degradation did not account for the reduced GSIS, but providing substrates and activation of GDH partially restored insulin secretion, pointing to a diminished glutamate supply as a contributing factor. Remarkably, exogenous GABA restored insulin secretion in β cells and human islets with suppressed AASS-dependent lysine catabolism, supporting a role for GABA as both a metabolic substrate and signaling effector. Together, these findings identify AASS-mediated lysine catabolism as a critical regulator of β-cell metabolic integrity, linking impaired lysine metabolism to GABA depletion, mitochondrial dysfunction, and secretory failure in T2D islets. They also underscore the nutritional importance of essential amino acids such as lysine in sustaining GSIS and glucose homeostasis, and support therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring lysine catabolism or GABA/glutamate balance to maintain β-cell function.", "authors": "Muñoz F; Gao Q; Mattanovich M; Trost K; Hodek O; Lindqvist A; Wierup N; Fex M; Moritz T; Mulder H; Cataldo LR", "fulltext_url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.metabol.2025.156423", "keywords": "Lysine degradation[MeSH Terms] AND rat[MeSH Terms]", "llm_relevance_assessment": {"relevance_score": 9, "relevance_level": "High", "species_check": "The pathway is in Rattus norvegicus (rat), and the article includes studies in rodent islets and β-cell lines, making it a valid model for the pathway species.", "evidence_summary": "Genes encoding enzymes in the lysine degradation pathway, including AminoAdipate-Semialdehyde Synthase (AASS), a key mitochondrial enzyme catalysing the first two steps of lysine catabolism, were present in human pancreatic islets and INS1 832/13 β cells.

Among the viral proteins shown to be expressed during lytic replication are potent signaling molecules such as vGPCR, vIL6, vIRFs, vCCLs, K1 and K15, which have been implicated experimentally in the angiogenic and inflammatory phenotype observed in KS lesions. Several of these latent viral and lytic proteins are known to transform host cells, linking KSHV with the development of severe human malignancies.", "genes": ["100361294"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "29051178", "title": "TLR4-Mediated Inflammation Promotes KSHV-Induced Cellular Transformation and Tumorigenesis by Activating the STAT3 Pathway.", "abstract": "Toll-like receptors (TLR) are conserved immune sensors mediating antimicrobial and antitumoral responses, but recent evidence implicates them in promoting carcinogenesis in certain cancers. Kaposi sarcoma is caused by infection of Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) and is characterized by uncontrolled neoangiogenesis and inflammation. Here, we show that TLR4 is upregulated in KSHV-infected spindle tumor cells in human Kaposi sarcoma lesions. In a model of KSHV-induced cellular transformation, KSHV upregulated expression of TLR4, its adaptor MyD88, and coreceptors CD14 and MD2. KSHV induction of TLR4 was mediated by multiple viral miRNAs. Importantly, the TLR4 pathway was activated constitutively in KSHV-transformed cells, resulting in chronic induction of IL6, IL1β, and IL18. Accordingly, IL6 mediated constitutive activation of the STAT3 pathway, an essential event for uncontrolled cellular proliferation and transformation. TLR4 stimulation with lipopolysaccharides or live bacteria enhanced tumorigenesis while TLR4 antagonist CLI095 inhibited it. These results highlight an essential role of the TLR4 pathway and chronic inflammation in KSHV-induced tumorigenesis, which helps explain why HIV-infected patients, who frequently suffer from opportunistic bacterial infections and metabolic complications, frequently develop Kaposi sarcoma. <i>Cancer Res; 77(24); 7094-108. ©2017 AACR</i>.", "authors": "Gruffaz M; Vasan K; Tan B; Ramos da Silva S; Gao SJ", "fulltext_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5732873/", "keywords": "Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus infection[MeSH Terms] AND rat[MeSH Terms]", "llm_relevance_assessment": {"relevance_score": 9, "relevance_level": "High", "species_check": "The pathway is in rat (Rattus norvegicus), but the study is in human Kaposi sarcoma and KSHV-infected human cells.

The other is reversible non-oxidative phase in which phosphorylated sugars are interconverted to generate xylulose-5P, ribulose-5P, and ribose-5P [MD:M00007]. Phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP) formed from ribose-5P [MD:M00005] is an activated compound used in the biosynthesis of histidine and purine/pyrimidine nucleotides.

In our study, we investigated the cell-autonomous effects of LN using immortalized non-tumorigenic rat (RNT) and human (THLE-2) hepatocytes. LN treatment induced cancer-like metabolic features in non-tumorigenic hepatocytes, including increased glycolysis, activation of both oxidative and non-oxidative pentose phosphate pathways (PPP), and reduced oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Additionally, LN increased several targets of the transcription factor nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2 (NRF2), a key regulator of cellular defense against stress. We found that activation of the Kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1)-NRF2 pathway was associated with increased hepatocyte proliferation. Importantly, silencing NRF2 completely abolished the LN-induced metabolic reprogramming. In contrast, triiodothyronine (T3), a liver mitogen that does not activate NRF2, failed to trigger metabolic reprogramming.

β3-adrenergic receptors (ARs) are upregulated in diseased hearts and mediate antithetic effects to those of β1AR and β2AR. β3AR agonists were recently shown to protect against myocardial remodeling in preclinical studies and to improve systolic function in patients with severe heart failure. However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. METHODS: To dissect functional, transcriptional, and metabolic effects, hearts and isolated ventricular myocytes from mice harboring a moderate, cardiac-specific expression of a human <i>ADRB3</i> transgene (β3AR-Tg) and subjected to transverse aortic constriction were assessed with echocardiography, RNA sequencing, positron emission tomography scan, metabolomics, and metabolic flux analysis. Subsequently, signaling and metabolic pathways were further investigated in vivo in β3AR-Tg and ex vivo in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes adenovirally infected to express β3AR and subjected to neurohormonal stress. These results were complemented with an analysis of single-nucleus RNA-sequencing data from human cardiac myocytes from patients with heart failure. RESULTS: Compared with wild-type littermates, β3AR-Tg mice were protected from hypertrophy after transaortic constriction, and systolic function was preserved. β3AR-expressing hearts displayed enhanced myocardial glucose uptake under stress in the absence of increased lactate levels. Instead, metabolomic and metabolic flux analyses in stressed hearts revealed an increase in intermediates of the pentose-phosphate pathway in β3AR-Tg, an alternative route of glucose utilization, paralleled with increased transcript levels of NADPH-producing and rate-limiting enzymes of the pentose-phosphate pathway, without fueling the hexosamine metabolism. The ensuing increased content of NADPH and of reduced glutathione decreased myocyte oxidant stress, whereas downstream oxidative metabolism assessed by oxygen consumption was preserved with higher glucose oxidation in β3AR-Tg mice after transaortic constriction compared with wild type, together with increased mitochondrial biogenesis. Unbiased transcriptomics and pathway analysis identified NRF2 (NFE2L2) as an upstream transcription factor that was functionally verified in vivo and in β3AR-expressing cardiac myocytes, where its translocation and nuclear activity were dependent on β3AR activation of nitric oxide synthase and nitric oxide production through S-nitrosation of the NRF2-negative regulator Keap1.

Previous studies showed that NRF2 enhances the resistance of mouse hearts to chronic haemodynamic overload, at least in part by reducing oxidative stress. Evidence from other tissues suggests that NRF2 may modulate glucose intermediary metabolism but whether NRF2 has such effects in the heart is unclear. Here, we investigate the role of NRF2 in regulating glucose intermediary metabolism and cardiac function during disease stress. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cardiomyocyte-specific Keap1 knockout (csKeap1KO) mice, deficient in the endogenous inhibitor of NRF2, were used as a novel model of constitutively active NRF2 signalling. Targeted metabolomics and isotopomer analysis were employed in studies with 13C6-glucose in csKeap1KO and wild-type mice. Pharmacological and genetic approaches were utilized in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs) to explore molecular mechanisms. We found that cardiac-specific activation of NRF2 redirected glucose metabolism towards the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), a branch pathway of glycolysis, and mitigated pressure overload-induced cardiomyocyte death and cardiac dysfunction. Activation of NRF2 also protected against myocardial infarction-induced DNA damage in remote myocardium and cardiac dysfunction. In vitro, knockdown of Keap1 upregulated PPP enzymes and reduced cell death in NRVM subjected to chronic neurohumoral stimulation. These pro-survival effects were abolished by pharmacological inhibition of the PPP or silencing of the PPP rate-limiting enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. Knockdown of NRF2 in NRVM increased stress-induced DNA damage, which was rescued by supplementing the cells with either nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) or nucleosides, the two main products of the PPP.

Previously, we showed the pathological role of hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (HIF1) in post-hypoxic reoxygenation. This study aimed to investigate the effect of prenatal severe hypoxia (PSH) on HIF1α protein expression as well as on HIF1-dependent activity of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and anaerobic glycolysis in the hippocampus (HPC) of offspring that reached adulthood. METHODS: PSH was induced during the critical period of fetal hippocampal formation on gestation days 14-16 in a hypobaric chamber (180 Torr, 5% oxygen, 3 h). Subsequent studies were conducted on both the HPC of adult control and PSH rats under normal conditions, as well as in response to severe hypoxia (SH) or psycho-emotional stress (\"learned helplessness\" [LH] model). We evaluated HIF1α protein levels using both immunohistochemistry and Western blotting techniques. The amount of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) was also determined by Western blotting. Colorimetric enzymatic assays were employed to analyze enzymatic activity of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), the concentration of lactate, NADPH, reduced glutathione (GSHred), and malonic dialdehyde (MDA). RESULTS: We showed that PSH caused a stable increase in the content of HIF1α protein in the HPC, which was accompanied by an increase in the efficiency of anaerobic glycolysis. This was confirmed by increased LDH activity and lactate concentration. At the same time, the amounts of G6PD, NADPH, and GSHred decreased in the HPC of PSH rats, whereas the concentration of MDA, an oxidative stress marker, exceeded the control values. In a series of experiments using the LH or SH stress, it was shown that in the HPC of control rats, there was an increase in the amount of HIF1α in response to stress, which was also accompanied by more efficient anaerobic glycolysis and decrease of PPP-dependent NADPH production, similar to the intact PSH rats. In PSH rats, emotional stress resulted in higher HIF1α levels without affecting glycolysis or PPP.

As a result of excessive accumulation of copper in the organism, it causes damage in various organs and tissues and hemolysis in erythrocytes. Astaxanthin (ATX) is a pigment belonging to the xanthophyll family, which is an oxygenated derivative of carotenoids. Thanks to its powerful antioxidant properties, ATX has an extraordinary potential to protect the organism against various diseases, especially cancer. The main objective of this study was to investigate the toxic effect of copper ions on the glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), 6-phospho-gluconate dehydrogenase (6PGD), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) enzymes and the role of astaxanthin in reducing this effect. In in vivo study, Wistar Albino male rats (n=28) were randomly divided into 4 groups: the control group, copper (Cu2+) group, astaxanthin (ATX) group, and copper + astaxanthin (Cu2++ATX) group. The results show that G6PD enzyme activity in Cu2+ group was strongly inhibited (p ˂ 0.05), while in other groups, there were no significant effects compared to the control group (p ⩾ 0.05). 6PGD enzyme activity was significantly reduced in Cu2+ group compared to that in the control group (p ˂ 0.05), and GR enzyme activity was lower in Cu2+ group compared to that in the control group (p ˂ 0.05). Similarly, when GST enzyme activity was evaluated, a strong decrease was observed in the Cu2+ group compared to that in the control group (p ˂ 0.05), while the enzyme activity in the Cu2++ATX group approached the control group (p ⩾ 0.05). When TrxR enzyme activity level was examined, a statistically significant decrease was observed in the Cu2+ and Cu2++ATX groups (p ˂ 0.05), and the enzyme activity in the ATX group was found to be close to that in the control group. When in vitro results were evaluated, it was observed that copper ions inhibited G6PD enzyme purified from rat erythrocyte tissues with IC50=1.90 μM value and Ki = 0.97 μM ± 0.082 value and the inhibition was non-competitive.

in diabetic nephropathy (DN), although the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain poorly characterized. METHODS: To examine this, human tubule epithelial cells (HK-2 cells), rat kidney tubular epithelial cells (NRK-52E cells), kidney tissues of patients with biopsy-proven DN and healthy controls along with db/db mice (spontaneous diabetic kidney injury) and their db/m littermates were subject to a variety of imaging and analytical techniques. RESULTS: Mechanistically, downregulation of protein UHRF1 induced by high glucose disrupts its regulatory functions on both promoter methylation and protein ubiquitination of GRP78. This dysregulation causes GRP78 accumulation in the cytoplasm subsequently facilitating its nuclear translocation via interactions with the nucleocytoplasmic transport machinery. Notably, GRP78 nuclear translocation enhances a gene network associated with ER stress and apoptosis, intensifying kidney tubular epithelial cell injury. Compound screening identified the phenolic glycoside Parishin as a specific inhibitor of GRP78 nuclear translocation, effectively mitigating ER stress and demonstrates kidney-protective efficacy in db/db mice. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our findings establish the dual epigenetic regulatory mechanisms of GRP78 and demonstrate its role as a transcriptional regulator of ER stress-related gene expression, which drives tubular cells injury in DN.

Excessive fructose intake is a risk factor for podocyte injury. However, whether high fructose promotes podocyte senescence remains unknown. OBJECTIVES: To explore the pathological mechanism by which high fructose drives podocyte senescence and find natural compounds to alleviate podocyte senescence. METHODS: Podocyte senescence was characterized with senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) staining, Western blot, real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), comet assay and immunofluorescence. Proteomics analysis was performed to identify differentially expressed proteins in high fructose-exposed podocytes. Podocyte nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) and foot processes were observed by transmission electron microscopy. The mRNA and protein levels of nucleoporin 155 (Nup155) and inositol requiring mutant 80 (INO80) were detected by qRT-PCR, Western blot and immunofluorescence. Virtual screening was conducted to find natural compounds that target Nup155. RESULTS: High fructose increased SA-β-gal activity, protein level of p53, p21, p16 and phosphorylated histone H2AX (γ-H2AX), as well as mRNA expression of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α) in rat glomeruli and podocytes. Proteomic analysis unraveled a crucial molecule Nup155, which was decreased in high fructose-induced podocyte senescence. Meanwhile, the number of podocyte NPCs was also decreased in vivo and in vitro. Consistently, high fructose suppressed nuclear export of INO80 mRNA, thereby down-regulated INO80 protein expression in podocyte senescence. Deletion of Nup155 inhibited INO80 mRNA nuclear export to induce podocyte senescence, whereas overexpression of Nup155 or INO80 alleviated high fructose-induced podocyte senescence. Ferulic acid was found to up-regulate Nup155 by both direct binding to stabilize Nup155 protein and enhancing its transcription, to promote INO80 mRNA nuclear export in the mitigation of high fructose-caused podocyte senescence.

However, deleterious byproducts of oxidative phosphorylation process called reactive oxidative species (ROS) lead to mitochondrial dysfunction. If the damage is too excessive to be repaired, such mitochondria are selectively recognized and targeted for degradation by a specific mode of autophagy, termed mitophagy. The loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential can induce mitophagy, involving the kinase PINK1 and the E3 ligase Parkin. PINK1 serves as the sensor for the mitochondrial depolarization and recruits Parkin, followed by ubiquitin-dependent recruitment of mitophagy receptors. There are also several PINK1/Parkin-independent mitophagy pathways, in which a group of LIR-containing receptors are required in response to different stimuli. Mitophagy contributes to the maintenance of a healthy mitochondrial network and the prevention of programmed cell death.", "genes": ["100361891"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "41232657", "title": "NF-κB/TOM6/PINK1-mediated mitophagy attenuates vascular calcification: Luteolin as a therapeutic modulator.", "abstract": "Vascular calcification (VC), a significant contributor to cardiovascular risk, lacks effective therapies. The natural flavonoid luteolin (LU) shows therapeutic potential, but its mechanism against VC is not fully elucidated. This study identifies a novel pathway wherein LU attenuates VC by restoring mitophagy via the Nuclear Factor Kappa B (NF-κB)/Translocase of Outer Mitochondrial Membrane 6 (TOM6)/PTEN-induced kinase 1 (PINK1) pathway. In vitro, LU dose-dependently inhibited calcification in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and arterial rings, suppressing expression of osteogenic markers such as bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2), Runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), and restoring expression of contractile proteins such as alpha-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), smooth muscle protein 22-alpha (SM22). In vivo, LU ameliorated VC in Vitamin D<sub>3</sub> (VitD<sub>3</sub>)-overloaded mice and rats with chronic kidney disease (CKD). RNA sequencing identified TOM6 as a key gene upregulated during calcification and suppressed by LU. Functionally, TOM6 knockdown attenuated VC, whereas its overexpression exacerbated VC and reversed the anti-calcific effect of LU. Mechanistically, LU enhanced PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy by downregulating TOM6, thereby improving mitochondrial bioenergetics. Furthermore, LU directly binds the inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-B kinase subunits alpha and beta (IKKα/IKKβ), thereby inhibiting NF-κB nuclear translocation and TOM6 transcription.

globally. Underlying diseases can increase the risk factor of liver injury induced by APAP overdose. Hyperuricemia (HUA), a condition defined by an abnormally high serum uric acid (UA) concentration, is a recognized risk factor for various health conditions, such as gout, cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, and chronic kidney disease. Additionally, HUA is also associated with liver disease, such as non-alcoholic fatty liver and hepatocellular carcinoma. However, the safe dosage of APAP for patients with HUA and the role of HUA in APAP-induced hepatotoxicity remain unclear. This study of a cohort derived from the UK Biobank showed that participants with long-term APAP intake had a 1.26(1.02-1.58) higher odds of developing liver failure than the control group. Importantly, people with HUA had a 1.44(1.12-1.84) higher odds, and those with HUA at baseline had a 1.66(1.06-2.61) higher odds of progressing to liver failure than those with normal UA.

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether UA enhances peripheral nerve regeneration by activating TFEB-mediated mitophagy and inhibiting NLRP3 inflammasome activation. METHODS: In a rat sciatic nerve crush injury model and Schwann cell cultures, UA effects were evaluated using behavioral tests, histological analysis, transmission electron microscopy, immunofluorescence, Western blotting, and molecular docking. RESULTS: UA administration significantly improved sciatic functional index, reduced muscle atrophy, and enhanced axonal regeneration and remyelination. Mechanistically, UA promoted transcription factor EB (TFEB) nuclear translocation, upregulated autophagy-lysosomal genes, and facilitated clearance of damaged mitochondria, leading to reduced ROS levels and suppression of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. These effects were abolished by TFEB knockdown or autophagy inhibition, indicating a TFEB-dependent mechanism. Molecular docking suggested direct binding between UA and TFEB.

Jisheng decoction alleviates intervertebral disc degeneration via the acacetin-mediated MAPK1/HMOX1 axis by inhibiting nucleus pulposus cell pyroptosis.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is the main pathological basis of low back pain, and its occurrence is closely related to the dysfunction of nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs). Although several studies have investigated the role of oxidative stress, apoptosis, and inflammation in IVDD, the specific molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of pyroptosis and mitophagy remain unclear. This study aims to explore the effect and molecular mechanism of Duhuo Jisheng Decoction (DHJS) and its active component Acacetin (ACA) against IVDD. METHODS: In this study, the therapeutic effects of DHJS on IVDD were first evaluated both in vitro and in vivo using histological staining, Western blotting, ROS detection, and flow cytometry. Ultra-high-performance Liquid Chromatography coupled with Quadrupole-Orbitrap High-Resolution Mass Spectrometer (UHPLC-QE-MS) was employed to identify the active components of DHJS that entered systemic circulation. The role of ACA, a key bioactive compound, in regulating NPCs pyroptosis and mitophagy was further investigated through ROS staining, JC-1 mitochondrial membrane potential assay, flow cytometry, and Western blotting. Potential targets of ACA and mitogen-activated protein kinase 1(MAPK1) were identified using network pharmacology and mass spectrometry analysis. Finally, the therapeutic efficacy of ACA was validated in a rat model of IVDD. RESULTS: It was found that DHJS could significantly alleviate the pathological process of IVDD by inhibiting NPCs pyroptosis. Further studies revealed that ACA, the key active component of DHJS, directly bound to MAPK1 and inhibited its expression, thereby relieving the negative regulation of MAPK1 on heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1). This interaction enhanced NPCs mitophagy and ultimately suppressed pyroptosis. Notably, this is the first study to identify the Acacetin-MAPK1/HMOX1 axis as a regulatory pathway linking mitophagy and pyroptosis in IVDD. In vivo experiments further confirmed that ACA could reverse the collagen fiber disorder, proteoglycan reduction and enhanced expression of mitophagy-related proteins in the intervertebral disc tissue of IVDD rats. CONCLUSION: This study reveals a new mechanism by which DHJS regulates the function of NPCs through the Acacetin-MAPK1/HMOX1-mitophagy-pyroptosis axis.

MODY3, the most common subtype, results from mutations in the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1-alpha (HNF1α) gene. HNF1α is a transcription factor essential for pancreatic β-cell function and insulin production. Clinically, β-cells in MODY3 patients generally retain intact sulfonylurea receptor function, making sulfonylureas the preferred treatment. However, a novel loss-of-function variant, HNF1α-Q125ter, has been shown to induce sulfonylurea insensitivity in MODY3 patients. This study aimed to investigate the role and mechanism of HNF1α-Q125ter-mediated mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired mitophagy in new variant-induced β-cell dysfunction. Mitophagy-related protein and transcription levels were analysed by Western blotting and reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). Mitochondrial morphology was examined by transmission electron microscopy. Ins-1 cells were transfected with overexpression constructs for HNF1α-Q125ter or short hairpin RNA targeting HNF1a (shHNF1α) to assess its effects on mitochondrial function and mitophagy. Ins-1 cells expressing HNF1α-Q125ter showed decreased mitochondrial number, oxygen consumption, and energy metabolism.

Dapagliflozin exerts significant hypoglycemic and nephroprotective effects; however, the precise mechanisms underlying its renoprotective actions remain to be fully elucidated. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms through which dapagliflozin mitigates diabetic nephropathy (DN), with particular emphasis on its regulatory role in the Sirt1-Pink1-Parkin axis and the restoration of mitochondrial homeostasis via mitophagy. METHODS: Rats were fed a high-fat/high-sugar diet and streptozotocin. They were then divided into groups of various treatments. In vitro, high glucose-induced NRK-52E cell injury was treated with dapagliflozin. Evaluations included renal histopathology, urinary biomarkers, apoptosis, reactive oxygen species, mitochondrial membrane potential, and Sirt1/Pink1/Parkin pathway activation. RESULTS: Dapagliflozin exerted significant protective effects against streptozotocin-induced diabetic nephropathy. Dapagliflozin treatment in vitro restored mitochondrial membrane potential and reduced ROS levels in high glucose-induced NRK-52E cells. High glucose exposure markedly upregulated the expression of mitochondria-associated apoptotic proteins in NRK-52E cells, which was reduced by dapagliflozin. This study revealed that Sirt1/Pink1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy was suppressed in DN and high glucose-induced NRK-52E cells but was activated following dapagliflozin treatment.

apoptotic regulatory network unlocks the emerging impacts of semaglutide on 5-fluorouracil-induced testicular toxicity.", "abstract": "AIMS: One of the recent growing complications of neoplastic chemotherapy that is considered a challenge in their therapeutic protocol is testicular dysfunction. The pathogenesis of testicular injury is multifactorial, involving various pathogenic mechanisms, including oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS), and mitochondrial dysfunction. Semaglutide (Sema), a GLP1 agonist, is repurposed nowadays in multiple conditions ascribed to its effectiveness in shielding against oxidative stress and ERS, along with boosting mitochondrial biogenesis. Accordingly, this study proposes to investigate the use of Sema as adjunctive therapy in a 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment protocol to diminish its testicular dysfunction complications. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rats were allocated into five groups. Group I: normal control group; Group II was injected with Sema (12 μg/kg, s.c.) once weekly for 30 days. Groups III (5-FU group), IV, and V were injected with 5-FU (20 mg/kg, every other day, i.p.) for 30 days. Group IV (Sema-treated group) was injected with Sema, while group V (Blocker group) was injected with exendin 9-39 (50 μg/kg, once weekly, I.V.). KEY FINDINGS: The results revealed that activation of GLP-1 attenuated 5-FU-induced testicular dysfunction by enhancing the PINK-1/Parkin axis and mitochondrial biogenesis, eliminating ERS-related proteins (PERK, ATF6, GRP78, and CHOP). Sema activated the Nrf2/HO-1 hub, improved steroidogenesis and spermatogenesis by elevating STAR/DAZL and serum FSH, LH, and testosterone levels.

(CIH), but its molecular mechanisms and potential intervention strategies require further exploration. Atraric acid (AA), a compound extracted from oakmoss, has garnered attention due to its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. However, its protective effects on the cardioprotective effects in the context of CIH have not been systematically investigated. Through the establishment of CIH mouse models and H9C2 cell IH injury models, combined with histopathological analysis, mitochondrial function assessment, qPCR, immunofluorescence, and Western blot, the protective effects and molecular mechanisms of AA against CIH-induced myocardial injury were evaluated. Experimental groups included a control group, CIH group, and AA intervention groups with varying doses. AA treatment significantly alleviated CIH-induced cardiac damage, suppressed ROS accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress, and activated Pink1/Parkin pathway-mediated mitophagy by promoting FoxO3a nuclear translocation. Meanwhile, AA inhibited NLRP3 inflammasome activation and inflammatory responses. The protective effects of AA were reversed by autophagy inhibition or ROS enhancement, suggesting an interaction mechanism between mitophagy and inflammation regulation. This study is the first to demonstrate that AA mitigates CIH-related myocardial injury by enhancing mitophagy via the FoxO3a-PINK1/Parkin pathway while synergistically suppressing oxidative stress and NLRP3 inflammasome activation.

They contribute to many crucial metabolic processes such as fatty acid oxidation, biosynthesis of ether lipids and free radical detoxification. The biogenesis of peroxisomes starts with the early peroxins PEX3, PEX16 and PEX19 and proceeds via several steps. The import of membrane proteins into peroxisomes needs PEX19 for recognition, targeting and insertion via docking at PEX3. Matrix proteins in the cytosol are recognized by peroxisomal targeting signals (PTS) and transported to the docking complex at the peroxisomal membrane. Peroxisomes' deficiencies lead to severe and often fatal inherited peroxisomal disorders (PD). PDs are usually classified in two groups. The first group is disorders of peroxisome biogenesis which include Zellweger syndrome, and the second group is single peroxisomal enzyme deficiencies.", "genes": ["100362572"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "37257275", "title": "The mammalian peroxisomal membrane is permeable to both GSH and GSSG - Implications for intraperoxisomal redox homeostasis.", "abstract": "Despite the large amounts of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> generated in mammalian peroxisomes, cysteine residues of intraperoxisomal proteins are maintained in a reduced state. The biochemistry behind this phenomenon remains unexplored, and simple questions such as \"is the peroxisomal membrane permeable to glutathione?\" or \"is there a thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase in the organelle matrix?\" still have no answer. We used a cell-free in vitro system to equip rat liver peroxisomes with a glutathione redox sensor. The organelles were then incubated with glutathione solutions of different redox potentials and the oxidation/reduction kinetics of the redox sensor was monitored. The data suggest that the mammalian peroxisomal membrane is promptly permeable to both reduced and oxidized glutathione. No evidence for the presence of a robust thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase in the peroxisomal matrix could be found. Also, prolonged incubation of organelle suspensions with glutaredoxin 1 did not result in the internalization of the enzyme. To explore a potential role of glutathione in intraperoxisomal redox homeostasis we performed kinetic simulations.

METHODS: Dry M. oleifera leaves were water-extracted, and the phytocomposition was determined using HPLC and GC-MS. Obesity-related BPH symptoms were induced in male Sprague Dawley rats receiving a high-fat diet (HFD) for 12 weeks, plus testosterone propionate injected subcutaneously (10 mg/kg/day in corn oil) for 4 weeks.

RESULTS: the MLE treatment presented a dose-dependent effect in BPH animals, where the low and medium doses alleviated the BPH symptoms, as indicated by the restoration of redox homeostasis and nearly normalizing the inflammatory, oncogenic, and apoptotic transcriptome in treated prostates, reflected by the reversal of histopathological alterations.

Astaxanthin (ASX), a keto-carotenoid, has been confirmed to possess antitumor activity, yet studies on breast cancer are still limited. The present study was deployed to unveil ASX's antitumor effects, alone or combined with doxorubicin (DOX), on 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA)-induced mammary tumors in Sprague‒Dawley female rats. Five groups of rats were assigned (n = 10), including normal group, which received the vehicle only, whereas other groups received DMBA for tumor induction, after which: group 3 received ASX (25 mg/kg/day; orally), group 4 received DOX (2 mg/kg/week; i.p.), and group 5 received both drugs. This study focused on assessing the role of Notch-1 signaling with some miRNAs orchestrating the pathway. Herein, ASX boosted miR-34a expression, which decreased the level of Notch-1 protein. In addition, miR-34a upregulation halted cell cycle progression by augmenting p21 protein level and triggering apoptosis by decreasing survivin and increasing Bax protein levels. Moreover, the downregulated miR-146a and miR-210 were escorted by decreased NF-κB and VEGF protein levels, respectively, suggesting their potential role in angiogenesis. Remarkably, ASX/DOX combination showed greater effects than either agent alone. Correlation and bioinformatics analyses manifested a significant relationship among all studied parameters. The ASX's restorative effect was further confirmed by histopathological examination.

However, sorafenib remains a first-line therapeutic option for advanced patients and, in particular, for patients not eligible for immune checkpoint inhibitors, but its efficacy is limited by the onset of acquired resistance, highlighting the urgent need for predictive biomarkers. This study investigates the role of miR-22 in metabolic reprogramming and its potential as a biomarker in HCC. The analysis of miR-22 expression was performed in HCC patients and preclinical models by qPCR. Functional analyses in HCC cells evaluated GLUT1 as a direct miR-22 target. Cellular and metabolic assays evaluated the miR-22/GLUT1 axis's role in metabolic changes, tumor aggressiveness, and sorafenib response. Circulating miR-22 was analyzed in sorafenib-treated HCC patients and rats. MiR-22 was downregulated in HCCs and associated with aggressive tumor features. Functionally, miR-22 modulated the HIF1A pathway, enhanced survival in stressful conditions, promoted a glycolytic shift, and enhanced cancer cell plasticity and sorafenib resistance via GLUT1 targeting. In addition, high serum miR-22 levels were associated with sorafenib resistance in HCC patients and rats. GLUT1 inhibition sensitized low miR-22-expressing HCC cells to sorafenib in preclinical models.

The hallmark pathological findings are progressive myocyte loss and fibrofatty replacement, with a predilection for the right ventricle. A number of genetic studies have identified mutations in various components of the cardiac desmosome that have important roles in the pathogenesis of ARVC. Disruption of desmosomal function by defective proteins might lead to death of myocytes under mechanical stress. The myocardial injury may be accompanied by inflammation. Since regeneration of cardiac myocytes is limited, repair by fibrofatty replacement occurs. Several studies have implicated that desmosome dysfunction results in the delocalization and nuclear translocation of plakoglobin. As a result, competition between plakoglobin and beta-catenin will lead to the inhibition of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, resulting in a shift from a myocyte fate towards an adipocyte fate of cells. The ryanodine receptor plays a crucial part in electromechanical coupling by control of release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol. Therefore, defects in this receptor could result in an imbalance of calcium homeostasis that might trigger cell death.", "genes": ["100361457"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "25225338", "title": "Disease mutations in desmoplakin inhibit Cx43 membrane targeting mediated by desmoplakin-EB1 interactions.", "abstract": "Mechanisms by which microtubule plus ends interact with regions of cell-cell contact during tissue development and morphogenesis are not fully understood.

We characterize cell mechanical properties and molecular responses to oscillatory shear stress in cardiac myocytes expressing mutant forms of the desmosomal proteins, plakoglobin and plakophilin, which are linked to ARVC in patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: Cells expressing mutant plakoglobin or plakophilin showed no differences in cell-cell adhesion relative to controls, while knocking down these proteins weakened cell-cell adhesion. However, cells expressing mutant plakoglobin failed to increase the amount of immunoreactive signal for plakoglobin or N-cadherin at cell-cell junctions in response to shear stress, as seen in control cells. Cells expressing mutant plakophilin exhibited a similar attenuation in the shear-induced increase in junctional plakoglobin immunoreactive signal in response to shear stress, suggesting that the phenotype is independent of the type of mutant protein being expressed. Cells expressing mutant plakoglobin also showed greater myocyte apoptosis compared with controls. Apoptosis rates increased greatly in response to shear stress in cells expressing mutant plakoglobin, but not in controls. Abnormal responses to shear stress in cells expressing either mutant plakoglobin or plakophilin could be reversed by SB216763, a GSK3β inhibitor.

The activation pathways are regulated both positively and negatively by the interactions of numerous signaling molecules. Mast cells that are thus activated release preformed granules which contain biogenic amines (especially histamines) and proteoglycans (especially heparin). The activation of phospholipase A2 causes the release of membrane lipids followed by development of lipid mediators such as leukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4 and LTE4) and prostaglandins (especially PDG2). There is also secretion of cytokines, the most important of which are TNF-alpha, IL-4 and IL-5.

Although stabilization of ordered lipid nanodomains around antigen-crosslinked IgE-FcεRI is known to facilitate necessary coupling with Lyn tyrosine kinase to initiate transmembrane signaling in these mast cells, the relationship of ordered-lipid nanodomains to membrane topography had not been determined. With nanoscale resolution provided by MVC, standard error of the mean (SEM), and colocalization probability (CP) analysis, we found that FcεRI and Lyn kinase are positioned primarily on the microvilli of resting mast cells in separate nano-assemblies. Upon antigen-activation, FcεRI and Lyn merge into overlapping populations together with the LAT scaffold protein, accompanied by merger of microvilli into ridge-like ruffles. With selective lipid probes, we further found that ordered-lipid nanodomains preferentially occupy microvillar membranes, contrasting with localization of disordered lipids to flatter regions. With this proximity of signaling proteins and ordered lipid nanodomains in microvilli, the mast cells are poised to respond sensitively and efficiently to antigen but only in the presence of this stimulus. Use of a short chain ceramide to disrupt ordered-lipid regions of the plasma membrane and evaluation with MVC, CP, and flow cytometry provided strong evidence that the microvillar selective localization of signaling proteins and membrane environments is facilitated by the interplay between ordered-lipid nanodomains and actin attachment proteins, ERM (ezrin, radixin, moesin), and cofilin.", "authors": "Ghosh S; Wagenknecht-Wiesner A; Desai S; Vyphuis J; Ramos MS; Grazul JL; Baird BA", "fulltext_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12305035/", "keywords": "Fc epsilon RI signaling pathway[MeSH Terms] AND rat[MeSH Terms]", "llm_relevance_assessment": {"relevance_score": 9, "relevance_level": "High", "species_check": "The pathway is in Rattus norvegicus (rat), and the study uses RBL mast cells, which are derived from rat basophilic leukemia cells, making the species alignment highly relevant.", "evidence_summary": "We showed with microvillar cartography (MVC) that key signaling proteins for RBL mast cells localize to these topographical features...

Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-γ) has recently been identified as being involved in the anti-inflammatory response by inhibiting mast cell activation. METHOD: In this study, the PPAR-γ agonist pioglitazone (PIO) was employed to evaluate the effects of PPAR-γ on the degranulation and production of pro-inflammatory mediators in RBL-2H3 cells. Meanwhile, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were characterised in mast cells exposed to PIO, and pathway enrichment analysis were conducted. Furthermore, we conducted validation to confirm the involvement of PPAR-γ signaling pathways in the FcεRI-mediated signal transduction in mast cells. RESULTS: Administration of PIO significantly reduced the release of β-hexosaminidase and the mRNA expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by the cross-linking of FcεRIs expressed on the surface of RBL-2H3 cells. A total of 24 DEGs were identified between RBL-2H3 cells treated with and without PIO, and there were 15 up-regulated and 9 down-regulated. GO and KEGG analyses revealed that the immune system, signal transduction, infectious disease, and signaling molecules and interactions were the most enriched annotations. According to PPI network analysis, most DEGs interacted with PPAR-γ. PPAR-γ agonist could activate PPAR-γ and NRF2 signaling pathways in resting RBL-2H3 cells. The protein expression levels of PPAR-γ, Cpt1a, and Acsl4 were greatly upregulated in activated RBL-2H3 cells mediated by FcεRI aggregation.

The development of new drugs for the treatment of asthma is warranted to alleviate these issues. Recent studies have demonstrated that sirtuin2 (SIRT2) aggravates asthmatic inflammation by up-regulation of T-helper type 2 responses and macrophage polarization. However, effects of SIRT2 on mast cell activation remain obscure. In this study, we investigated the effects of AGK2, an inhibitor for SIRT2, on mast cell-mediated allergic airway inflammation. Pre-treatment with AGK2 inhibited degranulation of mast cells by suppressing the FcεRI signaling pathway and intracellular calcium influx. The expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-8, was inhibited via regulation of transcription factors such as NF-κB and NRF2. These effects of AGK2 were verified in passive cutaneous anaphylaxis and acute lung injury animal models. AGK2 attenuated Evans blue pigmentation by inhibiting mast cell activation and lung barrier dysfunction by inhibiting inflammatory responses in these animal models. In the ovalbumin (OVA)-induced allergic airway inflammation murine model, AGK2 alleviated allergic asthma symptoms such as lung histological changes (immune cell and mast cell infiltration, collagen deposition, and α-smooth muscle actin expression) and serum immunoglobulins (Ig) levels (IgE, OVA-specific IgE, IgG1, and IgG2a). Moreover, AGK2 reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-4, IL-5, and IL-6) and inflammatory mediators (myeloperoxidase, eosinophil peroxidase, and tumor growth factor-α) in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and lung tissues. In addition, the anti-fibrotic effects of AGK2 were verified using lung epithelial cells and TGF-β/Smad reporter stable cells. In conclusion, our findings suggest that SIRT2 plays a role in mast cell-mediated airway inflammatory disease.

In the CNS, ACh facilitates many functions, such as learning, memory, attention and motor control. When released in the synaptic cleft, ACh binds to two distinct types of receptors: Ionotropic nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChR) and metabotropic muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs). The activation of nAChR by ACh leads to the rapid influx of Na+ and Ca2+ and subsequent cellular depolarization. Activation of mAChRs is relatively slow (milliseconds to seconds) and, depending on the subtypes present (M1-M5), they directly alter cellular homeostasis of phospholipase C, inositol trisphosphate, cAMP, and free calcium. In the cleft, ACh may also be hydrolyzed by acetylcholinesterase (AChE) into choline and acetate.

While ginsenoside Rg1 (Rg1) has demonstrated neuroprotective and antioxidative effects in various models of neurodegenerative disease, the mechanisms underlying its therapeutic potential in VD pathogenesis have yet to be systematically elucidated. PURPOSE: This study investigate the therapeutic potential of Rg1 in VD using a bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (2-VO) rat model and simultaneously explored the molecular mechanisms underlying its pharmacological effects. METHODS: To systematically assess the therapeutic efficacy of Rg1 on VD, we employed a well-established rat model of 2-VO. Behavioral outcomes were evaluated using standardized tests, histopathological changes were analyzed following histologic staining, and oxidative stress markers were quantified through biochemical analyses. Additionally, untargeted metabolomic profiling of serum and brain tissues was performed using UPLC-LTQ-Orbitrap MS, followed by targeted metabolomics to quantify essential amino acids and neurotransmitters. Additionally, integrated network pharmacology, transcriptomics, molecular docking, microscale thermophoresis (MST), qRT-PCR and western blotting were performed to facilitate a detailed investigation of the therapeutic potential of Rg1 and its molecular mechanisms in VD. RESULTS: Rg1 significantly ameliorated cognitive deficits and neuronal damage in rats with VD. Metabolomics revealed its unique ability to restore amino acid homeostasis and rebalance key neurotransmitters, including acetylcholine and glutamate. Mechanistically, Rg1 activated Adcy1 and Kdr, in turn enhancing cholinergic synapse integrity, and modulating the PI3K-AKT pathway to attenuate oxidative stress. Notably, molecular docking simulations displayed robust binding interactions between Rg1 and target proteins (all binding energies <-7 kcal/mol), and microscale thermophoresis (MST), qRT-PCR and western blotting findings revealed high consistency with multi-omics predictions. CONCLUSION: Thie findings of this reveals novel evidence that Rg1 alleviates VD by restoring amino acid homeostasis and neurotransmitter equilibrium, thereby activating Adcy1/Kdr-mediated cholinergic synapse and PI3K-AKT signaling pathway.

However, knowledge on the extent of macro- and microstructural changes of sleep during early, presymptomatic stages of AD is limited. We hypothesize that Aβ-induced perturbations of neuronal activity disrupt this oscillatory activity during sleep at pre-plaque stages of AD. In this study, we aimed to assess hippocampal oscillatory activity during sleep at pre- and early-plaque stages of AD, by performing 24-hour hippocampal electrophysiological measurements in TgF344-AD rats and wildtype littermates at pre- and early-plaque stages of AD. To provide a mechanistic understanding, histological analysis was performed to quantify GABA-ergic, glutamatergic and cholinergic synapses. We observed a differential impact of AD on hippocampal activity during rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM) sleep, in the absence of robust changes in circadian rhythm. TgF344-AD rats demonstrated increased duration of sharp wave-ripples during NREM sleep, irrespective of age. Interestingly, a significantly decreased theta-gamma coupling was observed in TgF344-AD rats, prior to amyloid plaque deposition, which was partially restored at the early-plaque stage. The partial recovery of hippocampal activity during REM sleep coincided with an increased number of cholinergic synapses in the hippocampus during the early-plaque stage in TgF344-AD rats, suggestive of basal forebrain cholinergic compensation mechanisms.

It ranges from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, and even hepatocellular carcinoma. Alcohol consumption promotes liver inflammation by increasing the translocation of gut-derived endotoxins to the portal circulation and activating Kupffer cells to produce TNF-alpha through the LPS/Toll like receptor (TLR) 4 pathways. TNF-alpha\u0005 induces hepatocellular damage. When alcohol intake is chronic and heavy, steatosis is caused via generation of acetaldehyde, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ER stress. ROS inhibits key hepatic transcriptional regulators such as AMP-activated kinase (AMPK) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR-alpha), which are responsible for fatty acid oxidation and export via ACC and CPT-1. The blockade of AMPK also leads to overexpression of SREBP-1, resulting in an increase of de novo lipogenesis. Moreover, excessive intracellular ROS production induced by ethanol and its metabolite have a critical role in ethanol-induced apoptosis, which may be the critical process in the exacerbation of ALD.

While abstinence reverses damage, its effect on protein half-lives remains unclear. This study examines site-specific protein half-life changes, transcription regulation, and recovery mechanisms. METHOD: Long-Evans rats were fed ethanol or control diets for 24 weeks to induce ALD, with some switched to a control diet for 7 days to model abstinence. Protein half-lives, pathways, and transcription factors were analyzed using deuterium labeling and were validated in ALD rats, abstinent rats, and human biopsies. RESULTS: Liver histology showed increased steatosis (28 %) and fibrosis (15 %) in ALD rats, both reduced with abstinence (<20 %, <12 %, p < 0.05). Liver function and lipid profiles improved, while alcohol-metabolizing and inflammatory markers were decreased (>1.5-fold, p < 0.05) following abstinence. ALD induced change in protein half-life specific to liver (82↑, 54↓), intestine (26↑, 30↓), and plasma (11↑, 17↓). Abstinence modulated; liver (64↑, 62↓), intestine (13↑, 25↓), and plasma (10↑, 12↓; FC > 1.5, p < 0.05). Specifically, abstinence reversed protein half-lives linked to lipid metabolism in the liver, neurodegeneration in the intestine, and NET formation in plasma (p < 0.05). Abstinence restored protein half-lives of Cyp2d10, Ugt1a1, Slc27a5, and Hsp90b1, regulated by Srebf1. Proteomic validation confirmed increased Acat1, Ugt1a1, and Slc27a5 in ALD, linked to steatosis and inflammation, which decreased with abstinence. Severe alcoholic hepatitis patients also documented that abstinence work on modulating protein turnover under the Srebf1-Slc27a5 axis and thereby ameliorate liver damage.

The pathogenesis of ALD is multifactorial, and existing therapeutic agents primarily target specific aspects of the disease while presenting significant side effects, including drug-induced liver injury and hepatobiliary disease. Silibinin (SLB) has attracted widespread attention for its hepatoprotective effects and favorable safety profile. However, inherent limitations associated with SLB, such as poor solubility and bioavailability, have significantly limited its clinical application. Drug delivery systems, including liposomes, offer promising potential for the delivery of hydrophobic drugs. However, the selection of an appropriate delivery vehicle requires optimization. Ursodeoxycholic acid sodium (UAS) serves as a promising alternative to cholesterol in liposomal formulations, offering a potential strategy to mitigate the health risks associated with cholesterol. In this study, UAS was employed as the liposomal membrane material to prepare a UAS liposome loaded with SLB (SUL), and its efficacy and mechanism of action in alcoholic-induced liver injury were subsequently evaluated. The experimental results demonstrated that SUL exhibited a uniform particle size distribution, good stability, and an effective release profile <i>in vitro</i>. Following oral administration, SUL effectively inhibited alcohol-induced liver damage, oxidative stress, and fat accumulation. In addition, SUL regulated the expression of the kelch-1ike ECH- associated protein l (Keap1), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1) proteins, thereby exerting antioxidative stress effects. Furthermore, it also modulated apoptosis-related factors, including B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), BCL-2-associated X (Bax), cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase-3 (Caspase-3), and cleaved caspase-3, to mitigate hepatocyte apoptosis.

They are transported to the plasma membrane as cleaved, but otherwise intact polypeptides. Interaction with ligand leads to two additional proteolytic cleavages that liberate the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) from the plasma membrane. The NICD translocates to the nucleus, where it forms a complex with the DNA binding protein CSL, displacing a histone deacetylase (HDAc)-co-repressor (CoR) complex from CSL.

We propose an injectable, degradable and ROS-responsive hydrogel delivery system (LNP-LOXL2@Gel), which mimics the biomechanical properties of natural intervertebral disc tissues and can be used as a sustained-release vehicle for LNP-LOXL2. Its ROS scavenging ability complements the intracellular anti-aging effect of LOXL2, blocking the cascade of \"oxidative stress-cellular senescence-ECM degradation\". In the rat IDD model, LNP-LOXL2@Gel not only reduced nucleus pulposus senescence, but also inhibited ECM catabolism by decreasing the expression of ROS in the microenvironment, thus partially restoring the physiological function of the intervertebral disc.

The osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) forms the biological basis of bone formation. Astragaloside IV (A-IV), a major active component of Astragalus membranaceus, is known to enhance osteogenesis, but its precise molecular mechanisms remain unclear. This study aims to investigate the effects of A-IV on the proliferation and osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs from osteoporotic rats and to elucidate its molecular mechanism through the regulation of microRNA-21 (miR-21) and Notch2 expression. METHODS: After 1 week of adaptive feeding, mature female SD rats were randomly divided into a sham-operated (Sham) group (<i>n</i>=4) and an ovariectomized (OVX) group (<i>n</i>=8) to establish an osteoporosis model. Twelve weeks after surgery, BMSCs were isolated from femoral bone marrow and cultured. Cells were divided into a S-BMSCs group (from Sham), an O-BMSCs group (from OVX), and an A-BMSCs group (from OVX-derived BMSCs treated with A-IV). S-BMSCs and O-BMSCs were induced for osteogenic differentiation using osteogenic induction medium, whereas A-BMSCs were treated with A-IV before induction. Flow cytometry was used to identify mesenchymal stem cell surface markers (CD29) and hematopoietic stem cell marker (CD34) to confirm BMSC characteristics. Cell proliferation was assessed using the methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay. Alizarin red staining was performed to quantify calcium nodule formation, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity assays were used to evaluate osteogenic differentiation. Real-time reverse transcription PCR (real-time RT-PCR) was used to detect changes in osteogenic-related genes, runt-related transcription factor 2 (<i>Runx2</i>) and osteopontin (<i>OPN</i>), as well as miR-21 expression. Western blotting was performed to assess Runx2, OPN, and Notch2 protein expression. RESULTS: Flow cytometry confirmed that O-BMSCs retained the phenotypic characteristics of mesenchymal stem cells. A-IV significantly enhanced the proliferation of BMSCs from osteoporotic rats (<i>P</i><0.05), increased ALP activity, and upregulated the mRNA and protein expression of <i>Runx2</i> and <i>OPN</i> (<i>P</i><0.05). Bioinformatic and experimental analyses demonstrated that miR-21 directly targeted Notch2. A-IV treatment increased miR-21 expression while suppressing Notch2 protein expression and inhibiting activation of the Notch signaling pathway (<i>P</i><0.05).

However, the mechanisms by which exosomes facilitate liver regeneration following portal vein ligation (PVL) remain unclear. Our previous research highlighted the critical role of the Notch signaling pathway in liver regeneration after PVL. Nevertheless, the involvement of liver-derived exosomes in actively promoting regeneration through the YAP-Notch signaling pathway and their role in cell proliferation have not been fully explored. In this study, we demonstrate that exosomes from hypertrophic liver tissue can activate the YAP-Notch signaling pathway both in vitro and in vivo, thereby promoting liver regeneration after PVL. Specifically, we show that these exosomes carry JAG1, which activates Notch signaling in recipient cells, a process that is inhibited by JAG1 antibodies. Co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry (Co-IP-MS) identified JAG1 interactors, confirming that ALG-2 plays a critical role in linking SEC31A and Alix to facilitate the intracellular transport and sorting of JAG1 onto exosomes. Additionally, we reveal that YAP induces hepatocyte reprogramming into Sox9<sup>+</sup> liver progenitor cells (LPCs) and promotes the release of JAG1<sup>+</sup> exosomes via the SEC31A/ALG-2/Alix axis, thereby activating Notch signaling in neighboring cells and enhancing liver regeneration.

preliminary mechanisms of icariin (ICA) in enhancing the reparative effects of adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) on skin radiation damagies in rats. METHODS: Twelve SPF-grade Sprague Dawley rats [body weight (220±10) g] were subjected to a single dose of 10 Gy X-ray irradiation on a 1.5 cm×1.5 cm area of their dorsal skin, with a dose rate of 200 cGy/min to make skin radiation damage model. After successful modelling, the rats were randomly divided into 4 groups ( <i>n</i>=3), and on day 2, the corresponding cells were injected subcutaneously into the irradiated wounds: group A received 0.1 mL of rat ADSCs (1×10 <sup>7</sup>cells/mL), group B received 0.1 mL of rat ADSCs (1×10 <sup>7</sup>cells/mL)+1 μmol/L ICA (0.1 mL), group C received 0.1 mL of rat ADSCs (1×10 <sup>7</sup>cells/mL) pretreated with a hypoxia-inducible factor 2α (HIF-2α) inhibitor+1 μmol/L ICA (0.1 mL), and group D received 0.1 mL of rat ADSCs (1×10 <sup>7</sup>cells/mL) pretreated with a Notch1 inhibitor+1 μmol/L ICA (0.1 mL). All treatments were administered as single doses. The skin injury in the irradiated areas of the rats was observed continuously from day 1 to day 7 after modelling. On day 28, the rats were sacrificed, and skin tissues from the irradiated areas were harvested for histological examination (HE staining and Masson staining) to assess the repair status and for quantitative collagen content detection. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to detect CD31 expression, while Western blot and real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) were used to measure the protein and mRNA relative expression levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor BB (PDGF-BB), fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2), interleukin 10 (IL-10), transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), HIF-2α, and Notch1, 2, and 3. RESULTS: All groups exhibited skin ulcers and redness after irradiation. On day 3, exudation of tissue fluid was observed in all groups. On day 7, group B showed significantly smaller skin injury areas compared to the other 3 groups. On day 28, histological examination revealed that the epidermis was thickened and the dermal fibers were slightly disordered with occasional inflammatory cell aggregation in group A. In group B, the epidermis appeared more normal, the dermal fibers were more orderly, and there was an increase in new blood vessels without significant inflammatory cell aggregation. In contrast, groups C and D showed significantly increased epidermal thickness, disordered and disrupted dermal fibers. Group B had higher collagen fiber content than the other 3 groups, and group D had lower content than group A, with significant differences ( <i>P</i><0.05). Immunohistochemical staining showed that group B had significantly higher CD31 expression than the other 3 groups, while groups C and D had lower expression than group A, with significant differences ( <i>P</i><0.05).

The Notch signaling pathway, known for its sensitivity to mechanical forces, is a regulator of strain-induced phenotypic plasticity of VSMCs. However, the impact of the intricate mechanical environment within the vessel wall on Notch signaling and VSMCs is not completely elucidated. In this study, we investigated the influence of strain anisotropy, which is important for understanding (patho)physiological mechanical conditions, on mechanosensitive Notch signaling and subsequent changes in VSMC phenotype. Using varying amplitudes of cyclic strain in the physiological range, we examined the effects of equibiaxial and uniaxial strain on Notch signaling and phenotypic transitions in synthetic and contractile VSMCs. Additionally, we compared cell responses between equibiaxial and uniaxial loading conditions by analyzing three different deformation characteristics to determine the primary strain measure governing Notch signaling and VSMC phenotype. Our findings reveal that both cyclic equibiaxial and uniaxial strain downregulate Notch signaling and contractile characteristics of VSMCs. Notably, these reductions are most similar for both loading conditions when the maximum principal strain values were compared. Overall, our results suggest that VSMCs respond in a comparable manner to equibiaxial and uniaxial strain, indicating that strain anisotropy may not significantly influence Notch signaling or phenotypic switching of VSMCs. Insight Box:  Vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) adapt their phenotype during vascular growth and remodeling in response to mechanical cues. The Notch signaling pathway, sensitive to mechanical stimuli, regulates this phenotypic plasticity. However, the effect of strain anisotropy, which is important for understanding (patho)physiological mechanical conditions, on Notch signaling and subsequent changes in VSMC phenotype is not clear. Understanding this relationship is crucial to determine how VSMC phenotype, contributing to vascular growth and remodeling, is regulated in physiological and pathological hemodynamic environments. Here, we showed that both equibiaxial and uniaxial strain downregulate Notch signaling components and the contractile properties of VSMCs.

Berberine, a natural compound, has shown potential cardioprotective effects. This study aims to investigate the protective role of berberine in myocardial cells post-ischemia-reperfusion injury, focusing on its modulation of the Neurogenic locus notch homolog protein (Notch) signaling pathway. METHODS: Male rats were subjected to ischemia-reperfusion injury and treated with berberine. Triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) and hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining were used to assess myocardial tissue damage and structure. Gene expression of Neurogenic locus notch homolog protein 1 (<i>Notch1</i>), Hairy and enhancer of split-1 (<i>Hes1</i>), B-cell lymphoma 2 (<i>Bcl-2</i>), and Bcl-2-associated X protein (<i>Bax</i>) was analyzed using Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction (qPCR). Apoptosis rate in myocardial cells was evaluated using Terminal deoxynucleotidyl Transferase dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) staining. Protein expression of Bcl-2 and Bax was examined. Molecular docking and Microscale Thermophoresis (MST) validation were performed to investigate the interaction between berberine and Notch1. RESULTS: Berberine treatment was associated with effective protection of myocardial tissue post-ischemia-reperfusion, indicated by reduced infarct area (<i>p</i> < 0.05) and improvements in tissue structure. Coinciding with these observations, berberine also influenced the expression of Notch1, Hes1, Bcl-2, and Bax in myocardial tissue, alongside modulation of Bcl-2 and Bax protein levels (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Additionally, molecular studies revealed that berberine binds to Notch1, suggesting a potential interaction. CONCLUSION: The study suggests an association between berberine's cardioprotective effects and Notch signaling pathway modulation in the context of myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury. While berberine was found to bind Notch1 and affect gene and protein expression related to apoptosis, further research is necessary to determine whether these effects directly contribute to reduced apoptosis and enhanced cell survival.", "authors": "Jiang D; Tang X; Yang H; Cheng H", "fulltext_url": "https://doi.org/10.24976/Discov.Med.202537196.81", "keywords": "Notch signaling pathway[MeSH Terms] AND rat[MeSH Terms]", "llm_relevance_assessment": {"relevance_score": 9, "relevance_level": "High", "species_check": "The pathway is for Rattus norvegicus (rat), and the study uses male rats as the experimental model, ensuring species consistency.", "evidence_summary": "This study aims to investigate the protective role of berberine in myocardial cells post-ischemia-reperfusion injury, focusing on its modulation of the Neurogenic locus notch homolog protein (Notch) signaling pathway.

Newly synthesized peptides enter the ER via the sec61 pore and are glycosylated. Correctly folded proteins are packaged into transport vesicles that shuttle them to the Golgi complex. Misfolded proteins are retained within the ER lumen in complex with molecular chaperones. Proteins that are terminally misfolded bind to BiP and are directed toward degradation through the proteasome in a process called ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER causes ER stress and activates a signaling pathway called the unfolded protein response (UPR). In certain severe situations, however, the protective mechanisms activated by the UPR are not sufficient to restore normal ER function and cells die by apoptosis.", "genes": ["100359803"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "34389474", "title": "Involvement of kisspeptin in androgen-induced hypothalamic endoplasmic reticulum stress and its rescuing effect in PCOS rats.", "abstract": "Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, with adaptive unfolded protein response (UPR), is a key link between obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, all of which are often present in the most common endocrine-metabolic disorder in women of reproductive age, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which is characterized with hyperandrogenism.

In direct contrast to the role of CUL7 in regulating both ER and peripheral quality controls of Eag1, MKRN1 is exclusively responsible for the early stage of Eag1 maturation at the ER. We further demonstrated that both CUL7 and MKRN1 contribute to protein quality control of additional disease-causing Eag1 mutants associated with defective protein homeostasis.

First, NMDA treatment disrupts binding of pro-NRG2 to ER-PM junctions by post-translationally modifying conserved Ser/Thr residues in its intracellular domain. Second, using a mutant NRG2 protein that cannot be modified at these residues and that fails to accumulate at ER-PM junctions, we demonstrate that NMDARs also directly promote NRG2 shedding by ADAM-type metalloproteinases.

{"id": "rno04510", "name": "Focal adhesion - Rattus norvegicus (rat)", "description": "Cell-matrix adhesions play essential roles in important biological processes including cell motility, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, regulation of gene expression and cell survival. At the cell-extracellular matrix contact points, specialized structures are formed and termed focal adhesions, where bundles of actin filaments are anchored to transmembrane receptors of the integrin family through a multi-molecular complex of junctional plaque proteins. Some of the constituents of focal adhesions participate in the structural link between membrane receptors and the actin cytoskeleton, while others are signalling molecules, including different protein kinases and phosphatases, their substrates, and various adapter proteins. Integrin signaling is dependent upon the non-receptor tyrosine kinase activities of the FAK and src proteins as well as the adaptor protein functions of FAK, src and Shc to initiate downstream signaling events. These signalling events culminate in reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton; a prerequisite for changes in cell shape and motility, and gene expression. Similar morphological alterations and modulation of gene expression are initiated by the binding of growth factors to their respective receptors, emphasizing the considerable crosstalk between adhesion- and growth factor-mediated signalling.", "genes": ["100361457"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "36961871", "title": "Microgroove Cues Guiding Fibrogenesis of Stem Cells via Intracellular Force.", "abstract": "Groove patterns are widely used in material surface modifications.

This study aimed to clarify the effect and mechanism of LIPUS on the osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and implant osseointegration, and to provide an experimental basis for future clinical applications. METHODS: Dental implants were inserted into Wistar rat femurs, and LIPUS was performed for 4 weeks. Micro-CT and toluidine blue staining were used to assess implant osseointegration. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses were used to identify enriched functional terms and signalling pathways for differentially expressed genes from LIPUS-treated rat BMSC RNAseq data obtained from the GEO database. The random forest method was used to identify key risk genes according to the mean decrease Gini (MDG) coefficient. Then, LIPUS was applied to treat rat BMSCs, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining, alizarin red staining, RT-PCR and western blotting were used to determine whether LIPUS could promote BMSC osteogenic differentiation via integrin α11 (ITGA11) and the focal adhesion pathway. RESULTS: Our in vivo experimentations verified that LIPUS significantly increased new bone formation and osseointegration around the implant in rats. Bioinformatics analysis of RNA-seq data revealed that the upregulated genes in BMSCs after LIPUS treatment were significantly enriched in osteoblast differentiation-related functions and focal adhesion-related pathways. Random forest analysis revealed that ITGA11 was the most significant factor affecting BMSC osteogenic differentiation among the differentially expressed genes. In addition, LIPUS significantly increased ALP expression and mineralized nodule formation in rat BMSCs by upregulating ITGA11 and increasing the activity of FAK/PI3K/AKT/GSK3β/β-catenin pathway.

Since integrins (extracellular matrix binding receptors) are important mediators of HSC activation and fibrogenesis, we hypothesized that focal adhesion (FA) proteins, which link integrins to the intracellular protein machinery, may be important in the activation process. Therefore, using both an in vitro model of activation in primary rat HSCs and an in vivo model of liver injury, we examined three FA proteins: vinculin, FAK, and talin.

Gubi Zhitong Formula (GBZTF) is a Traditional Chinese Medicine prescription used for the treatment of KOA. Composed of Rehmannia glutinosa, Epimedium brevicornum, Cistanche deserticola, Pyrola calliantha, Drynaria roosii, Spatholobus suberectus, and Raphanus raphanistrum subsp. sativus, it has the effects of tonifying the kidney, promoting blood circulation, and relieving pain, but its mechanism of action remains unclear. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the therapeutic effect of GBZTF and its potential mechanism in improving KOA induced by excessive mechanical loading in rats. METHOD: Excessive mechanical loading was applied to rat right knee joints to establish KOA models using a static testing system in a dynamic cyclic loading mode. Behavioral and bone changes were evaluated using gait analysis, weight-bearing tests, Micro-CT scans, Western blotting, qRT-PCR, and histological staining across all experimental groups. The mechanism underlying the beneficial effects of GBZTF on KOA was elucidated through transcriptome sequencing and subsequent validation. RESULTS: In this study, it was found that GBZTFM (2.42 g/kg/day) significantly improves exercise capacity of OA rats (P < 0.05), alleviates cartilage destruction (P < 0.05) and subchondral metabolic dysregulation (P < 0.05). It also downregulates key pro-inflammatory mediators in serum and joint fluid, including IL-1β (P < 0.01), IL-6 (P < 0.01) and TNF-α (P < 0.05), while enhancing anti-inflammatory factors TGF-β (P < 0.05) and IL-10 (P < 0.05).

We report that cocaine administration induces astrocyte reactivity in the nucleus accumbens, characterized by structural remodeling, reduced synaptic coverage, and upregulation of reactivity-associated markers, including STAT3.

This study identifies phospholipase Cγ1 (PLCγ1) inhibition in bone marrow MSCs (BMSCs) as a novel strategy to enhance bone repair through synergistic crosstalk with macrophages. In a rat femoral bone defect model, implantation of alginate hydrogels containing PLCγ1-knockdown BMSCs significantly improved bone regeneration and induced an reparative macrophage (M2-like macrophage) phenotype (increased CD206<sup>+</sup>, decreased CD80<sup>+</sup>) within the marrow cavity. In vitro, PLCγ1 knockdown in BMSCs robustly promoted osteogenic differentiation without affecting proliferation. Conditioned medium (CM) from siPLCγ1 BMSCs polarized bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) toward an reparative macrophage phenotype (reduced CD80, CD86, iNOS; increased CD206 and Arg1). Co-culture experiments revealed a reciprocal interaction: siPLCγ1 BMSCs polarized BMDMs, which in turn further enhanced BMSC osteogenesis and migration-exceeding the effects of classically induced reparative macrophage. PLCγ1 knockdown increased IL-4 expression and secretion, activating the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. Corresponding JAK2-STAT3 activation and reparative polarization (M2 polarization) were observed in BMDMs treated with siPLCγ1 BMSC CM.

Traditionally, it has been used to treat disorders associated with phlegm-dampness accumulation and digestive dysfunction, reflecting the TCM principle of harmonizing the stomach and resolving dampness. Within the clinical practice at Jiangyin Hospital Affiliated to Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine, WDD is employed for the treatment of chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG), continuing its long-standing application in gastrointestinal disorders. Despite its widespread traditional use and cultural significance, the active constituents and precise pharmacological mechanisms of WDD have not yet been fully elucidated. PURPOSE: This study aimed to systematically investigate the material basis and therapeutic mechanisms of WDD in CAG treatment. METHODS: The bioactive constituents of WDD were first identified using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS). To evaluate its therapeutic effects, we established both in vivo and in vitro models of chronic atrophic gastritis (CAG). For the in vivo studies, a rat CAG model was generated through a multi-factor compound induction approach, whereas in vitro cellular injury was induced using N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG). To elucidate the underlying mechanisms, we integrated network pharmacology to predict candidate targets and signaling pathways, followed by experimental verification via immunohistochemical staining and Western blot analysis. RESULTS: HPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS profiling revealed 34 bioactive constituents in WDD, with naringin, neohesperidin, and narirutin identified as key components. In vivo investigations demonstrated that WDD administration markedly improved gastric histopathological alterations in CAG model rats, accompanied by increased serum levels of pepsinogen I (PG I) and pepsinogen II (PG II), along with reduced gastrin-17 (G-17) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) concentrations. In vitro studies further showed that WDD treatment inhibited cell proliferation, migration, and invasive potential in MNNG-transformed MC cells. Network pharmacology-based analysis predicted that the therapeutic efficacy of WDD against CAG was primarily mediated via the JAK/STAT signaling axis. Subsequent mechanistic validation confirmed that WDD significantly attenuated the phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3, suggesting its inhibitory effect on the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that WDD exerted therapeutic effects on CAG through suppression of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, the chemical components of QJSB and serum constituents were identified using UPLC-Q-Qrbitrap HRMS technology. The potential anti-leukopenia mechanism and crucial components of QJSB was deciphered using combined approaches of transcriptomic analysis and network pharmacology analysis. Finally, the expression of key targets and the intervene effects of QJSB in the cyclophosphamide-induced leukopenia model of rats was verified by in vivo experiments. RESULTS: In total, 51 and 58 chemical components were identified from QJSB and serum respectively. The network pharmacology analysis indicated that the key components of QJSB was genistein, quercetin, 5,6,7-trimethoxyisoflavone, carbacyclin, linoleic acid, and caffeic acid, the key targets were PTPN11, LCK, STAT3, GRB2, FYN, SRC, PIK3R1, LYN, EGFR, PIK3CA, and the key pathways were PI3K-Akt, lipid and atherosclerosis, JAK-STAT, FoxO, and linoleic acid metabolism. Transcriptomics analysis revealed that 1171 genes were down-regulated and 382 genes were up-regulated by QJSB compared with model group. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis indicated that the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway is closely related to leukopenia. Animal experiments demonstrated that QJSB and its active components effectively increased serum levels of hematopoietic and immune-related cytokines, improved thymus index, spleen index, and bone marrow nucleated cell count in model rats through regulating PI3K-AKT signaling pathway and downstream transcription factors mTOR and FOXO3A.

effect of electroacupuncture (EA) at \"Jiaji\" (EX-B2) on inhibiting neuronal apoptosis in rats with spinal cord injury based on the Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signaling pathway, so as to explore the underlying mechanism of EA in the treatment of spinal cord injury. METHODS: A total of 36 SD rats were randomly divided into sham operation group, spinal cord injury group, and Jiaji EA group, with 12 rats in each group. The spinal cord injury model was established using Allen's method. The Jiaji EA group was treated with EA at EX-B2 (once a day, 30 min each time, for a total of 14 d). After the treatment, the Basso Beattie Bresnahan (BBB) score was used to evaluate the hindlimb motor function of rats in each group. HE staining was used to observe the morphological changes of spinal cord tissues. TUNEL staining was used to observe the pathological changes and neuronal apoptosis rate of the spinal cord. Western blot was used to detect the relative expression levels of phosphorylated (p)-JAK2, p-STAT3, B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), Bcl-2 associated X protein (Bax), and Caspase-3 proteins in the spinal cord. RESULTS: Compared with the sham operation group at the same time point, the BBB score decreased (<i>P</i><0.01), the spinal cord tissue structure in the injury area was disordered, the cell body shrank, and the neuronal apoptosis rate increased (<i>P</i><0.01), the expression levels of p-JAK2, p-STAT3, Bax, and caspase-3 proteins increased (<i>P</i><0.01) while the expression level of Bcl-2 protein decreased (<i>P</i><0.01) in rats of the spinal cord injury group. Compared with the spinal cord injury group, the BBB score increased on the 7<sup>th</sup> and 14<sup>th</sup> day of intervention (<i>P</i><0.01), the spinal cord tissue structure tended to be normal, the degree of neuronal damage was reduced, and the apoptosis rate decreased (<i>P</i><0.01), the expression levels of p-JAK2, p-STAT3, Bax, and caspase-3 proteins decreased (<i>P</i><0.01, <i>P</i><0.05), while the expression level of Bcl-2 protein increased (<i>P</i><0.05) in rats of the Jiaji EA group. CONCLUSIONS: EA at EX-B2 can improve the motor function of rats with spinal cord injury, up-regulate the expressions of anti-apoptotic factors, down-regulate the expressions of pro-apoptotic factors, and reduce neuronal apoptosis in spinal cord injury.

HT is characterized by the presence of goitre, thyroid autoantibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and thyroglobulin (Tg) in serum and varying degrees of thyroid dysfunction. During HT, self-reactive CD4+ T lymphocytes (Th) recruit B cells and CD8+ T cells (CTL) into the thyroid. Disease progression leads to the death of thyroid cells and hypothyroidism. Both autoantibodies and thyroid-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) have been proposed to be responsible for autoimmune thyrocyte depletion. In GD, the TSH-R is the most important autoantigen. Antibodies directed against it mimic the effects of the hormone on thyroid cells, TSH, stimulating autonomous production of thyroxine and triiodothyronine and causing hyperthyroidism. The presence of TSH-R-blocking antibodies that bind the TSH receptor in a similar fashion to the antibodies in patients with Grave's disease but that block rather than activate the receptor explains some cases of atrophic hypothyroidism.", "genes": ["100911527"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "39576556", "title": "Lactoferrin alleviates oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress induced by autoimmune thyroiditis by modulating the mTOR pathway in the thyroid.", "abstract": "Autoimmune thyroiditis (AITD) is a prevalent autoimmune disorder characterized by the immune system's attack on thyroid tissue, potentially leading to thyroid dysfunction, with a current lack of effective treatment modalities.

Several isozymes of this gene family exist in vertebrates, which vary in cellular location and substrate specificity. This isozyme has a high preference for lipid hydroperoxides and protects cells against membrane lipid peroxidation and cell death. It is also required for normal sperm development; thus, it has been identified as a 'moonlighting' protein because of its ability to serve dual functions as a peroxidase, as well as a structural protein in mature spermatozoa. Disruption of this gene in mouse spermatocytes is associated with male infertility. This isozyme is also a selenoprotein, containing the rare amino acid selenocysteine (Sec) at its active site. Sec is encoded by the UGA codon, which normally signals translation termination. The 3' UTRs of selenoprotein mRNAs contain a conserved stem-loop structure, designated the Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element, that is necessary for the recognition of UGA as a Sec codon, rather than as a stop signal. Transcript variants resulting from alternative splicing or use of alternate promoters have been described to encode isoforms with different subcellular localization.

OBJECTIVE: Shutiao Qiji Decoction is one of the Chinese traditional medicine prescriptions, which is commonly used to treat cancer, tumor, etc. It is also used for thyroid-related diseases in the clinic. Hashimoto's thyroiditis is an autoimmune disease. In this study, the mechanism of Shutiao Qiji Decoction in treating Hashimoto's thyroiditis was studied through network pharmacology and molecular docking verification. METHOD: Each Chinese medicine ingredient of Shutiao Qiji Decoction was retrieved from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP) database. The related genes of HT were searched from the UniProt and GeneCards databases. Meanwhile, we used Cytoscape to construct the protein-protein interaction (PPI) visual network analysis, and used the search tool to search the database of Interacting Genes (STRING) to build a PPI network. These key proteins were enriched and analyzed by molecular docking validation, Gene Ontology (GO), and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Hashimoto's thyroiditis disease model was established in SD rats, and SQD was administered by gavage after the successful establishment of the model. After 6 weeks of continuous administration of the drug by gavage, tissue samples were collected and the thyroid and spleen tissues were visualized by HE staining to verify the therapeutic effect. RESULTS: The results showed that there were 287 TCM active ingredients, 1920 HT-related disease targets, and 176 drug and disease targets in SQD. Through PPI analysis, GP analysis, and KEGG analysis of the common targets of drugs and diseases, we found their pathways of action to be mainly cancer action pathway, PI3K-AKT signaling pathway, and T-cell action pathway. The active ingredients of the drugs in SQD, malvidin, stigmasterol, porin-5-en-3bta-ol, and chrysanthemum stigmasterol, were docked with the related target proteins, MAPK, GSK3β, TSHR, and NOTCH molecules. The best binding energies obtained from docking were mairin with TSHR, stigmasterol with TSHR, poriferast-5-en-3beta-ol with MAPK, and chryseriol with GSK3β, with binding energies of -6.84 kcal/mol, -6.53 kcal/mol, -5.03 kcal/mol, and -5.05 kcal/mol, respectively. HE staining sections of rat thyroid and spleen tissues showed that SQD had a therapeutic effect on Hashimoto's thyroiditis and restored its immune function. CONCLUSION: It is verified by molecular docking results that Shutiao Qiji Decoction has a potential therapeutic effect on Hashimoto's thyroiditis in the MAPK/TSHR/NOTCH signal pathway, and that the main components, mairin, stigmasterol, poriferast-5-en-3beta-ol, and chryseriol play a role in it.

the mTOR and TLR4/NF-κB Signaling.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Autoimmune thyroiditis (AIT) is a common autoimmune disease that causes thyroid dysfunction. Clinical symptoms in Hashimoto thyroiditis patients were improved after oral administration of dioscin. However, the mechanisms involved in the therapeutic effect remain unclear. METHODS: The protective effects and potential mechanisms of dioscin for autoimmune thyroiditis were explored in a rat model of thyroglobulin-induced autoimmune thyroiditis. Firstly, the rat model of AIT was obtained by subcutaneous injection of thyroglobulin and drinking the sodium iodide solution, followed by gavage administration for 8 weeks. Rats were sacrificed after anaesthesia, serum and thyroid samples were preserved. Serum triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), free triiodothyronine (FT3), free thyroxine (FT4), thyrotropin (TSH), thyroglobulin antibody (TgAb), thyroid peroxidase antibody (TPOAb), and thyrotropin receptor antibody (TRAb) expressions were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Morphological changes were observed by H&E staining. Next, we used transcriptomics techniques to find the potential therapeutic target of dioscin. Finally, we validated the transcriptomic results by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC-P), respectively. RESULTS: Animal experiments showed that dioscin regulated T3, T4, FT3, TSH, TgAb, TPOAb, and TRAb and alleviated the pathological process in a dose-dependent manner, with the high-dose group showing optimal efficacy.

{"id": "rno04973", "name": "Carbohydrate digestion and absorption - Rattus norvegicus (rat)", "description": "Dietary carbohydrate in humans and omnivorous animals is a major nutrient. The carbohydrates that we ingest vary from the lactose in milk to complex carbohydrates. These carbohydrates are digested to monosaccharides, mostly glucose, galactose and fructose, prior to absorption in the small intestine. Glucose and galactose are initially transported into the enterocyte by SGLT1 located in the apical brush border membrane and then exit through the basolateral membrane by either GLUT2 or exocytosis. In a new model of intestinal glucose absorption, transport by SGLT1 induces rapid insertion and activation of GLUT2 in the brush border membrane by a PKC betaII-dependent mechanism. Moreover, trafficking of apical GLUT2 is rapidly up-regulated by glucose and artificial sweeteners, which act through T1R2 + T1R3/alpha-gustducin to activate PLC-beta2 and PKC-beta II. Fructose is transported separately by the brush border GLUT5 and then released out of the enterocyte into the blood by GLUT2.", "genes": ["100270683"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "40186371", "title": "Glucose absorption by isolated, vascularly perfused rat intestine: A significant paracellular contribution augmented by SGLT1 inhibition.", "abstract": "AIM: Intestinal glucose transport involves SGLT1 in the apical membrane of enterocytes and GLUT2 in the basolateral membrane. In vivo studies have shown that absorption rates appear to exceed the theoretical capacity of these transporters, suggesting that glucose transport may occur via additional pathways, which could include passive mechanisms. The aim of the study was to investigate glucose absorption in an in vitro model, which has proven useful for endocrine studies. METHODS: We studied both transcellular and paracellular glucose absorption in the isolated vascularly perfused rat small intestine. Glucose absorbed from the lumen was traced with <sup>14</sup>C-d-glucose, allowing sensitive and accurate quantification. SGLT1 and GLUT2 activities were blocked with phlorizin and phloretin. <sup>14</sup>C-d-mannitol was used as an indicator of paracellular absorption. RESULTS: Our results indicate that glucose absorption in this model involves two transport mechanisms: transport mediated by SGLT1/GLUT2 and a paracellular transport mechanism. Glucose absorption was reduced by 60% when SGLT1 transport was blocked and by 80% when GLUT2 was blocked. After combined luminal SGLT1 and GLUT2 blockade, ~30% of glucose absorption remained. d-mannitol absorption was greater in the proximal small intestine compared to the distal small intestine. Unexpectedly, mannitol absorption increased markedly when SGLT1 transport was blocked. CONCLUSION: In this model, glucose absorption occurs via both active transcellular and passive paracellular transport, particularly in the proximal intestine, which is important for the understanding of, for example, hormone secretion related to glucose absorption. Interference with SGLT1 activity may lead to enhanced paracellular transport, pointing to a role in the regulation of the latter.", "authors": "Bæch-Laursen C; Ehrenreich RK; Modvig IM; Veedfald S; Holst JJ", "fulltext_url": "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC11971594/", "keywords": "Carbohydrate digestion and absorption[MeSH Terms] AND rat[MeSH Terms]", "llm_relevance_assessment": {"relevance_score": 9, "relevance_level": "High", "species_check": "The pathway is for Rattus norvegicus (rat), and the study uses the rat as the experimental model, ensuring full species alignment.", "evidence_summary": "Intestinal glucose transport involves SGLT1 in the apical membrane of enterocytes and GLUT2 in the basolateral membrane.

can be transported via intestinal glucose transporters (IGTs), and the presence of carbohydrate excipients in pharmaceutical formulations may influence the absorption of them. This study, using gastrodin as probe drug, aimed to explore the effects of fructose, lactose, and arabic gum on intestinal drug absorption mediated by the glucose transport pathway. METHODS: The influence of fructose, lactose, and arabic gum on gastrodin absorption was assessed via pharmacokinetic experiments and single-pass intestinal perfusion. The expression of sodium-dependent glucose transporter 1 (SGLT1) and sodium-independent glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) was quantified via RT‒qPCR and western blotting. Alterations in rat intestinal permeability were evaluated through H&E staining, RT‒qPCR, and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Fructose reduced the area under the curve (AUC) and peak concentration (C<sub>max</sub>) of gastrodin by 42.7% and 63.71%, respectively (P < 0.05), and decreased the effective permeability coefficient (P<sub>eff</sub>) in the duodenum and jejunum by 58.1% and 49.2%, respectively (P < 0.05). SGLT1 and GLUT2 expression and intestinal permeability remained unchanged. Lactose enhanced the AUC and C<sub>max</sub> of gastrodin by 31.5% and 65.8%, respectively (P < 0.05), and increased the P<sub>eff</sub> in the duodenum and jejunum by 33.7% and 26.1%, respectively (P < 0.05). SGLT1 and GLUT2 levels did not significantly differ, intestinal permeability increased. Arabic gum had no notable effect on pharmacokinetic parameters, SGLT1 or GLUT2 expression, or intestinal permeability.

Mammals express at least four distinctly regulated groups of MAPKs, extracellular signal-related kinases (ERK)-1/2, Jun amino-terminal kinases (JNK1/2/3), p38 proteins (p38alpha/beta/gamma/delta) and ERK5, that are activated by specific MAPKKs: MEK1/2 for ERK1/2, MKK3/6 for the p38, MKK4/7 (JNKK1/2) for the JNKs, and MEK5 for ERK5. Each MAPKK, however, can be activated by more than one MAPKKK, increasing the complexity and diversity of MAPK signalling. Presumably each MAPKKK confers responsiveness to distinct stimuli. For example, activation of ERK1/2 by growth factors depends on the MAPKKK c-Raf, but other MAPKKKs may activate ERK1/2 in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli.", "genes": ["100360982"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "41274591", "title": "Angiotensin II-induced fibrosis is mediated by activation of FGFR1 pathway in renal epithelial cells: Attenuation by chimeric peptide.", "abstract": "Renal fibrosis is a prominent pathophysiologic change seen with the progression of chronic kidney disease. Angiotensin II (Ang II), the central peptide of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS), is known to cause fibrosis under various disease conditions. Fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR1) plays a critical role in epithelial to mesenchymal transition and tubulointerstitial fibrosis, but its role in Ang II-induced fibrosis in renal epithelial cells (RECs) and renal fibroblasts (RFbs) remains poorly understood. Our study aimed to investigate the role of FGFR1 in Ang II-induced fibrosis in both REC, RFbs and explore the potential of chimeric peptide (CP) in attenuating it. We developed a time-dependent in vitro fibrosis model using REC exposed to Ang II and analyzed the expression of FGFR1 and fibrotic markers by qPCR. Oxidative stress and profibrotic markers were measured using confocal imaging and flow cytometry. In RFbs, we also examined fibrotic cell proliferation and collagen deposition using proliferation assays and Sirius red staining. Our findings show that Ang II significantly increases FGFR1, AT<sub>1</sub> receptor, and oxidative stress markers through the ERK/MAPK pathway. Simultaneously, it downregulates MAS1 and pGC-A expression, protective pathways of the RAAS system. However, co-treatment with CP, which targets MAS1 and pGC-A, reversed the harmful changes caused by Ang II. In conclusion, our study suggests that Ang II-induced fibrosis is mediated through FGFR1, AT<sub>1</sub> receptor activation, and CP can more effectively counteract these effects than individual peptides by dual activation of the protective pathways of the RAAS system.", "authors": "Venkadakrishnan J; Bhat A; Jadhav KB; Dhar A", "fulltext_url": "https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2025.178390", "keywords": "MAPK signaling pathway[MeSH Terms] AND rat[MeSH Terms]", "llm_relevance_assessment": {"relevance_score": 8, "relevance_level": "High", "species_check": "The pathway is in rat (Rattus norvegicus), and the study involves renal epithelial cells and fibroblasts, likely from a rat model, given the MeSH terms and biological context.", "evidence_summary": "Our findings show that Ang II significantly increases FGFR1, AT<sub>1</sub> receptor, and oxidative stress markers through the ERK/MAPK pathway.", "reasoning": "The article directly investigates the ERK/MAPK pathway in the context of Ang II-induced fibrosis.

Existing treatments can merely delay disease progression, failing to prevent RGC loss or visual field defects. For the management of ophthalmic diseases, Scutellarin (Scu) has demonstrated neuroprotective potential, but its efficacy and mechanisms in glaucoma remain unexplored. This study aims to evaluate the neuroprotective role of Scu in glaucoma and to reveal its underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Cell viability was assessed using CCK-8 and Hoechst 33342/propidium iodide staining. RGC damage and visual function were evaluated via flash visual evoked potential, immunofluorescence and hematoxylin-eosin staining. The potential targets and pathways were identified by network pharmacology, whereas the Scu-target binding affinity was evaluated by molecular docking and cellular thermal shift assay. Expression of key genes was silenced using siRNA, and protein levels were analyzed by Western blotting. RESULTS: Scu significantly mitigated the damage in a glutamate-induced retinal excitotoxicity glaucoma model. Network pharmacology and molecular docking identified Hsp90AA1 as a key target. Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis associated the protective effects of Scu with the MAPK pathway, which was further supported by GO analysis that highlights its role in apoptosis regulation. Overall, Scu was found to mitigate apoptosis by modulating the Hsp90aa1-MAPK pathway, evidenced by the fact that Hsp90aa1 knockdown abolished the protective effects of Scu.

ferroptosis-related signaling pathways and inflammatory responses, and to assess its effects on cartilage integrity and subchondral bone microstructure. METHODS: A total of 66 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to six groups: control, model, diclofenac sodium (DCF), and BSCSF high-dose (BSCSF-H), medium-dose (BSCSF-M), and low-dose (BSCSF-L) groups. KOA was induced via intra-articular injection of monosodium iodoacetate. Following induction, BSCSF or DCF was administered orally for 4 weeks. Therapeutic outcomes were assessed through Lequesne MG scores, body weight measurements, histopathological evaluation (hematoxylin and eosin, Safranin O-Fast Green staining), and micro-computed tomography of the subchondral bone. Expression levels of ferroptosis-associated proteins (SLC7A11, GPX4, p38 MAPK, MMP-13), glutathione (GSH), and iron accumulation (Fe²⁺), as well as inflammatory cytokines (IL-1β, TNF-α), were also measured. RESULTS: When compared to the model group, rats in the BSCSF-H and BSCSF-M groups exhibited significantly lower Lequesne MG scores, improved cartilage morphology, and enhanced subchondral bone microstructure, as indicated by increased bone volume fraction, trabecular thickness, trabecular number, and connectivity density along with decreased bone surface-to-volume ratio and trabecular separation. These groups also demonstrated increased expression of SLC7A11 and GPX4, elevated GSH levels, and reduced Fe²⁺ accumulation in cartilage, suggesting attenuation of ferroptosis. Inflammatory mediators, including IL-1β, TNF-α, MMP-13, and p38 MAPK, were significantly downregulated, indicating reduced inflammation and extracellular matrix degradation. The BSCSF-L group indicated modest improvements, primarily in inflammatory parameters and joint function.

This isozyme has a high preference for lipid hydroperoxides and protects cells against membrane lipid peroxidation and cell death. It is also required for normal sperm development; thus, it has been identified as a 'moonlighting' protein because of its ability to serve dual functions as a peroxidase, as well as a structural protein in mature spermatozoa. Disruption of this gene in mouse spermatocytes is associated with male infertility. This isozyme is also a selenoprotein, containing the rare amino acid selenocysteine (Sec) at its active site. Sec is encoded by the UGA codon, which normally signals translation termination. The 3' UTRs of selenoprotein mRNAs contain a conserved stem-loop structure, designated the Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element, that is necessary for the recognition of UGA as a Sec codon, rather than as a stop signal.

It mainly functions as a signal for 26S proteasome dependent protein degradation. The addition of ubiquitin to proteins being degraded is performed by a reaction cascade consisting of three enzymes, named E1 (ubiquitin activating enzyme), E2 (ubiquitin conjugating enzyme), and E3 (ubiquitin ligase). Each E3 has specificity to its substrate, or proteins to be targeted by ubiquitination. Many E3s are discovered in eukaryotes and they are classified into four types: HECT type, U-box type, single RING-finger type, and multi-subunit RING-finger type. Multi-subunit RING-finger E3s are exemplified by cullin-Rbx E3s and APC/C. They consist of a RING-finger-containing subunit (RBX1 or RBX2) that functions to bind E2s, a scaffold-like cullin molecule, adaptor proteins, and a target recognizing subunit that binds substrates.", "genes": ["100359803"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "40272610", "title": "UCHL1-Mediated Spastin Degradation Regulates Microtubule Severing and Hippocampal Neurite Outgrowth.", "abstract": "As a key component of the cytoskeleton, microtubule dynamic provides structural support for neurite outgrowth.

Overexpression of UCHL1 decreased the protein level of spastin, while the genetic knockdown of UCHL1 increased that of spastin. CHX chase assay showed that UCHL1 regulated the protein degradation of spastin. Application of proteasome inhibitor MG-132 suppressed UCHL1-mediated spastin degradation.

Our study aims to identify circ-ITCH-mediated novel approach to facilitate osteogenic differentiation in DOP. METHODS: A rat DOP model and human BM-MSCs under microgravity condition were generated as in vivo and in vitro models of DOP, respectively. The bone mineral density (BMD) and bone parameters were examined in rats. The histological changes of bones and mineralization were monitored by H&E, Alcian blue and Alizarin red S staining. Co-IP was employed to examine the ubiquitination of HOXC10 and the interaction between HOXC10 and BRCA1. The direct associations among circ-ITCH, IGFBP2 and BRCA1 mRNA were assessed by RIP, FISH and RNA pull-down assays. RESULTS: Circ-ITCH was downregulated in rat model of DOP and BM-MSCs under microgravity stimulation. Circ-ITCH overexpression promoted osteogenic differentiation in BM-MSCs under microgravity condition. The altered bone parameters, such as BMD, trabecular number (Tb.N), trabecular separation (Tb.Sp), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th), and bone microstructure in DOP rats were rescued by circ-ITCH overexpression.

Additionally, protein turnover is crucial for sustained metabolic homeostasis in cardiomyocytes. OBJECTIVE: Here, we studied the role of mTOR in OPA-1 cleavage and its consequent effects on mitochondrial dynamics and energetics in cardiomyocytes. RESULTS: Cultured rat cardiomyocytes treated with rapamycin for 6-24 h showed a significant reduction in phosphorylation of p70S6K, indicative of sustained inhibition of mTOR. Structural and functional analysis revealed increased mitochondrial fragmentation and impaired bioenergetics characterized by decreases in ROS production, oxygen consumption, and cellular ATP. Depletion of either the mitochondrial protease OMA1 or the mTOR regulator TSC2 by siRNA, coupled with an inducible, cardiomyocyte-specific knockout of mTOR in vivo, suggested that inhibition of mTOR promotes mitochondrial fragmentation through a mechanism involving OMA1 processing of OPA-1. Under homeostatic conditions, OMA1 activity is kept under check through an interaction with microdomains in the inner mitochondrial membrane that requires prohibitin proteins (PHB). Loss of these microdomains releases OMA1 to cleave its substrates. We found that rapamycin both increased ubiquitination of PHB1 and decreased its abundance, suggesting proteasomal degradation. Consistent with this, the proteasome inhibitor MG-132 maintained OPA-1 content in rapamycin-treated cardiomyocytes. Using pharmacological activation and inhibition of AMPK our data supports the hypothesis that this mTOR-PHB1-OMA-OPA-1 pathway impacts mitochondrial morphology under stress conditions, where it mediates dynamic changes in metabolic status.

CDC20 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that plays a role in cell cycle progression and apoptosis in various types of cancers. The involvement of CDC20 in DOX-induced cardiotoxicity (DIC) is poorly understood. Hence, this study aimed to explore the potential role of CDC20 in the development of DIC and assess whether CDC20 influences the antitumor effects of DOX. METHODS AND RESULTS: H9C2 cells were treated with DOX, followed by transcriptomic analysis to identify differentially expressed genes. C57BL/6 mice were treated with DOX for 4 weeks after tail vein injection of CDC20 myocardial-specific knockout mice, AAV9-cTNT-(si) CDC20, or intraperitoneal injection of apcin. Cardiac function and pathological changes were evaluated by echocardiography and pathological staining, respectively. The influence of CDC20 on DOX-induced tumor inhibition was assessed in tumor-bearing mice. In vitro analysis involved treating cardiomyocytes with the Ad-CDC20 adenovirus and DOX, followed by proteomic and ubiquitination-related assays to identify potential downstream ubiquitinated CDC20 proteins. Additionally, we investigated the effect of CCDC69 on CDC20-mediated protection against DOX-induced apoptosis using CCDC69 shRNA. Transcriptome analysis revealed that DOX effectively suppressed the expression of CDC20. Cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of CDC20 in a DOX-induced mouse model of myocardial injury effectively mitigated cardiomyocyte apoptosis, inflammation, fibrosis, and cell atrophy. Our mechanistic investigation revealed that CDC20 attenuates DOX-induced apoptosis by downregulating CCDC69 expression. Moreover, cardiomyocyte-specific overexpression of CDC20 had no effect on the therapeutic efficacy of DOX against tumors.

Pericytes, one of the cell types that constitute the BBB, degrade various forms of α-Syn. However, the detailed mechanisms involved in α-Syn degradation by pericytes remain poorly understood. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to determine the ability of the BBB-constituting cells, particularly primary cultures of rat pericytes, brain endothelial cells, and astrocytes, to degrade α-Syn. After α-Syn uptake by the cells, intracellular α-Syn decreased only in pericytes.

However, pharmacological inhibitors of Akt, ERK, and p38 MAPK inhibited α-Syn degradation by pericytes.

Here, we report that mitochondrial dysfunction and cell apoptosis are prominent features of primary cardiomyocytes after exposure to high glucose/palmitate conditions. The protein level of MIC60, a core component of mitochondrial cristae, is decreased via ubiquitination and degradation under these conditions. Exogenous expression of MIC60 alleviates cristae disruption, mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis. Moreover, we identified MARCH5 as an E3 ubiquitin ligase that specifically targets MIC60 in this process. Indeed, MARCH5 mediates K48-linked ubiquitination of MIC60 at Lys285 to promote its degradation. Mutation of the ubiquitination site in MIC60 or the MIC60-interacting motifs in MARCH5 abrogates MARCH5-mediated MIC60 ubiquitination and degradation. Silencing MARCH5 significantly alleviates high glucose/palmitate-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis in primary cardiomyocytes. In addition to E3 ubiquitin ligases, molecular chaperones also play important roles in protein stability. We previously reported that the mitochondrial chaperone TRAP1 inhibits the ubiquitination of MIC60, but the detailed mechanism is unknown. Here, we find that TRAP1 performs this function by competing with MARCH5 for binding to MIC60. Our findings provide new insights into the mechanism underlying mitochondrial dysfunction in cardiomyocytes in diabetic cardiomyopathy. MARCH5 promotes ubiquitination of MIC60 to induce MIC60 degradation, mitochondrial dysfunction and apoptosis in cardiomyocytes under diabetic conditions.

Dysregulation of the autophagy-lysosomal pathway in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) mediates hyperphosphatemia-dependent VC. However, the process through which lysosomes become dysfunctional remains unknown. Transcription factor EB (TFEB) is a master regulator of lysosome biogenesis. The present study examined the hypothesis that TFEB dysfunction causes VC progression. METHODS AND RESULTS: Inorganic phosphate (Pi) dose-dependently promoted VC in mouse aorta ex vivo, in rat VSMCs in vitro, and in human aortic smooth muscle cells in vitro, all accompanied by a decrease in TFEB protein. Lysosomal inhibitors or TFEB knockdown using small interfering RNA exacerbated Pi-induced VC in VSMCs. Conversely, TFEB downregulation was not observed in the hypercalcemia-sensitive VC model induced by excessive vitamin D dosages. Feeding rats an adenine-containing diet caused CKD and hyperphosphatemia. VC occurred in the adenine-fed rat aorta and regressed after adenine cessation. In this CKD model, aortic TFEB expression decreased at VC onset but recovered to average levels during recovery from VC after adenine cessation. The calcified area of the CKD rat aorta exhibited lysosomal damage and enhanced TFEB ubiquitination. Hyperphosphatemia in vitro increased insoluble TFEB and decreased soluble TFEB in VSMCs, both of which were abrogated by the proteasome inhibitor, MG-132. CONCLUSION: Hyperphosphatemia caused VC via TFEB downregulation in VSMCs. Under hyperphosphatemia, TFEB was insolubilized and degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome system.

Our previous studies have found that the epigenetic molecule chromodomain Y-like (CDYL) negatively regulates dendritic branching. Current research mostly focuses on the processes downstream of CDYL, whereas the upstream regulatory process has not been investigated to date. In this study, we identified an upstream regulator of CDYL, the E3 ubiquitin ligase tripartite motif-containing protein 32 (TRIM32), which promotes dendrite arborization by mediating the ubiquitylation and degradation of CDYL. By using mass spectrometry and biochemistry strategies, we proved that TRIM32 interacted with CDYL and mediated CDYL ubiquitylation modification in vivo and in vitro. Overexpressing TRIM32 decreased the protein level of CDYL, leading to an increase in the dendritic complexity of primary cultured rat neurons. In contrast, knocking down TRIM32 increased the protein level of CDYL and decreased the dendritic complexity. The truncated form of TRIM32 without E3 ligase activity (ΔRING) lost its ability to regulate dendritic complexity. Most importantly, knockdown of CDYL abolished the reduced complexity of dendrites caused by TRIM32 knockdown, indicating that the TRIM32-mediated regulation of dendritic development depends on its regulation of downstream CDYL. Hence, our findings reveal that TRIM32 could promote dendrite arborization by mediating CDYL degradation.

The vertebrate cascade starts with the absorption of photons by the photoreceptive pigments, the rhodopsins, which consist of a membrane embedded chromophore, 11-cis-retinal, and a G-protein-coupled receptor, opsin. The photon isomerizes 11-cis-retinal to all-trans-retinal which induces a structural change that activates the opsin. This triggers hydrolysis of cGMP by activating a transducinphosphodiesterase 6 (PDE6) cascade, which results in closure of the cGMP-gated cation channels (CNG) in the plasma membrane and membrane hyperpolarization. The hyperpolarization of the membrane potential of the photoreceptor cell modulates the release of neurotransmitters to downstream cells.

visual disturbances such as phosphene in humans. Ivabradine-induced visual disturbances are caused by inhibition of HCN channels in the retina, and the mechanisms have been verified using HCN channel knockout mice and electroretinography (ERG). However, in rats, classical ERG using single flash light stimulus with standard analyses of waveform amplitude and latency has not revealed abnormal retinal function after administration of ivabradine. To verify whether retinal dysfunction after ivabradine administration was detectable in rats, we performed ERG using multistep flash light stimulation at the time when plasma concentration of ivabradine was high. Furthermore, the mechanism of the change in the waveform that appeared after the b-wave was investigated. Ivabradine and cilobradine, a selective HCN channel inhibitor, were administered subcutaneously to rats at 4-40 mg/kg as a single dose, and flash or long-duration ERG recordings at each light stimulus luminance were conducted 1.5 h after administration. Plasma and retinal concentrations of both compounds were measured immediately after the ERG recordings. In the flash ERG, prolongation of a- and/or b-wave latencies were detected at each light stimulus, and dose-dependent waveform changes after the b-wave were recorded at the specific light stimulus luminance for both compounds. These ERG changes increased in response to increasing plasma and retinal concentrations for both ivabradine and cilobradine. In the long-duration light stimulus ERG, a change in the waveform of the b-wave trough and attenuation of the c-wave were recorded, suggesting that the feedback control in the photoreceptor cells may be inhibited.

However, there are still no effective treatments for SCI, so it is important to explore and identify effective therapeutic strategies. As a natural compound extracted from walnuts, juglone has been previously reported to exhibit various biological activities, including anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory effects, but the effects on central nerve system are still blank. PURPOSE: This study aims to evaluate the therapeutic effects of juglone in spinal cord injury and elucidate its molecular mechanisms in neuroprotection. STUDY DESIGN: In vitro neuronal OGD/R experiments and in vivo spinal cord injury model experiments were employed to investigate the neuroprotective effects of juglone on neurons. METHODS: Neuronal OGD/R models and spinal cord injury models were used to detect the neuroprotective effect of juglone. Immunofluorescence, Western Blot and ELISA were employed to investigate the effects of juglone on necroptosis and pyroptosis of neurons. RNA-Seq analysis, immunoprecipitation, Western Blot, qRT-PCR, immunofluorescence and ChIP-qPCR were utilized to elucidate the molecular mechanism of its neuroprotective effect. RESULTS: Juglone can inhibit necroptosis and pyroptosis both in vivo and in vitro, thereby exerting neuroprotective effects. Mechanistically, we identify a novel FOS/USP53 signaling axis, in which juglone suppresses the expression of FOS that directly regulates the deubiquitinating enzyme USP53. Reduced FOS expression leads to the downregulation of USP53, thereby promoting the ubiquitination and degradation of MLKL and GSDMD. This cascade ultimately alleviates necroptosis and pyroptosis in injured neurons.

cardiotoxicity: Insights into mitochondria-endoplasmic reticulum crosstalk and necroptosis.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Osimertinib is a third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) widely used in non-small cell lung cancer. However, its cardiotoxicity has raised increasing clinical concern. The underlying mechanisms remain unclear. METHODS: We evaluated the effects of osimertinib on cardiac structure and function in mice and assessed cell viability, mitochondrial function, and cell death pathways in H9C2 and AC16 cardiomyocytes. Mitochondria-associated endoplasmic reticulum membranes (MAMs), mitochondrial calcium overload, and necroptosis were analyzed by immunofluorescence, transmission electron microscopy, calcium probes, and Western blotting. Genetic and pharmacologic modulation of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase 4 (PDK4) was used to probe its functional role. Protein-protein interactions were examined by co-immunoprecipitation and molecular docking. RESULTS: Osimertinib caused cardiac dysfunction and myocardial damage in vivo and triggered necroptosis in cardiomyocytes, characterized by increased phosphorylation of RIP3 and MLKL. Mechanistically, osimertinib upregulated PDK4, which promoted excessive MAM formation, mitochondrial calcium overload, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Co-immunoprecipitation revealed that PDK4 facilitated the interaction between BAP31 and FIS1, key tethering proteins at MAMs. Silencing PDK4 or inhibiting necroptosis with necrosulfonamide alleviated mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death. Conversely, PDK4 overexpression alone induced MAM formation, mitochondrial depolarization, and necroptotic signaling. Importantly, FIS1 knockdown mimicked the protective effects of PDK4 silencing. These results demonstrate that PDK4 contributes to osimertinib-induced cardiotoxicity by regulating MAM-associated necroptosis. CONCLUSION: Our findings identify a novel role for PDK4 in mediating osimertinib-induced cardiomyocyte necroptosis via MAM formation and mitochondrial calcium overload.

The molecular mechanism of wound development is still unclear. This study aims to preliminarily explore the programmed cell death mode that may be involved in hydrofluoric acid burns by using transcriptome sequencing technology and to provide a theoretical basis for a new treatment approach for hydrofluoric acid burns. METHODS: The rat model of hydrofluoric acid burn skin was constructed, and the differentially expressed genes after HF burn were screened by transcriptome sequencing technology. HE staining, TUNEL staining, immunohistochemistry, biochemical detection, and qRT-PCR were used to preliminarily verify the mode of cell death involved in hydrofluoric acid burn wounds. RESULTS: The sequencing results suggest that the differential genes after HF burn were enriched in ferroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis pathways in cell growth and death aspects. HE staining confirmed HF burn wounds were progressively aggravated. The positive cells of TUNEL staining in the wound gradually increased. Compared with the normal group, the content of MDA in serum and skin tissue increased and the content of GSH decreased at 4, 8, 12, 24, and 48 hours after HF burn (P < 0.05). The level of serum Fe<sup>2 +</sup> in the HF burn group was higher than that in the normal group at 4 h, 8 h, and 12 h postburn (P < 0.05). The level of serum Fe<sup>2+</sup> at 24 h and 48 h postburn was higher than that of the normal group, but the difference was not statistically significant. The content of Fe<sup>2+</sup> in skin tissue increased and reached its peak at 12 h (P < 0.05). The serum calcium level decreased to its lowest level at 24 hours postburn (P < 0.05). Immunohistochemistry showed that the expressions of GPX4, FTH1, and Bcl-2 proteins in hydrofluoric acid burn wounds were down-regulated, while the expression of HO-1, Bax, RIPK1, and MLKL was increased (P < 0.05). RIPK3 expression was not significantly different. qRT-PCR showed that the expression of HO-1, FTH1, SLC39A14, SLC39A8, CYBB, ACSL4, Bax, RIPK1, MLKL, IL-1β, and IL-6 increased, while the expression of ACSL1, ACSL6, GPX4, and Bcl-2 decreased after hydrofluoric acid burn compared with the normal group (P < 0.05).

Several isozymes of this gene family exist in vertebrates, which vary in cellular location and substrate specificity. This isozyme has a high preference for lipid hydroperoxides and protects cells against membrane lipid peroxidation and cell death. It is also required for normal sperm development; thus, it has been identified as a 'moonlighting' protein because of its ability to serve dual functions as a peroxidase, as well as a structural protein in mature spermatozoa. Disruption of this gene in mouse spermatocytes is associated with male infertility. This isozyme is also a selenoprotein, containing the rare amino acid selenocysteine (Sec) at its active site. Sec is encoded by the UGA codon, which normally signals translation termination. The 3' UTRs of selenoprotein mRNAs contain a conserved stem-loop structure, designated the Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element, that is necessary for the recognition of UGA as a Sec codon, rather than as a stop signal. Transcript variants resulting from alternative splicing or use of alternate promoters have been described to encode isoforms with different subcellular localization. Pseudogenes of this locus have been identified on chromosomes 1, 10 and 14.

The elevated intracellular cGMP level exerts its physiological action through two forms of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG), cGMP-regulated phosphodiesterases (PDE2, PDE3) and cGMP-gated cation channels, among which PKGs might be the primary mediator. PKG1 isoform-specific activation of established substrates leads to reduction of cytosolic calcium concentration and/or decrease in the sensitivity of myofilaments to Ca2+ (Ca2+-desensitization), resulting in smooth muscle relaxation. In cardiac myocyte, PKG directly phosphorylates a member of the transient potential receptor canonical channel family, TRPC6, suppressing this nonselective ion channel's Ca2+ conductance, G-alpha-q agonist-induced NFAT activation, and myocyte hypertrophic responses. PKG also opens mitochondrial ATP-sensitive K+ (mitoKATP) channels and subsequent release of ROS triggers cardioprotection.", "genes": ["100361818"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "40086518", "title": "Silencing RGS7 attenuates atrial fibrillation progression by activating the cGMP-PKG signaling pathway.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common diagnosed heart disease that needs novel managements. This study aimed to seek potential biomarkers and underlying regulatory pathways associated with AF. METHODS: Differential expressed genes (DEGs) were identified from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, followed by a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network to discover hub genes. Principal components analysis (PCA) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were performed to evaluate the ability of hub genes to discriminate between AF and control. RGS7 was selected as a key hub gene, and genes co-expressed with RGS7 were identified for functional enrichment analysis. Further in vivo and in vitro experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of silencing RGS7 on AF and the potential pathway. RESULTS: We identified top 5 hub genes (RGS7, EGFR, RGS4, GNA13 and RGS11) from the PPI network. PCA showed these genes could distinguish between AF and control samples, with 100 % of the area under curve (AUC) values. Silencing RGS7 inhibited cell apoptosis, inflammation and oxidative stress, and increased mitochondrial membrane potential in angiotensin II (AngII)-treated HL-1 cells, while overexpression of RGS7 reversed the inhibitory effects of silencing RGS7 on AF. Additionally, silencing RGS7 improved cardiac function and decreased cardiac fibrosis in AF rats. The cGMP-PKG signaling pathway was screened as a potential signal transduction pathway, and silencing RGS7 increased the expression of PKG1, while KT5823 blocked the process.

The study aims to understand how QLQX impacts cardiac function and underlying molecular pathways. METHODS: HFpEF was induced in a rat model through unilateral nephrectomy, DOCA pellet implantation, and a high-salt diet. Cardiac function was assessed via M-mode imaging and Doppler flow measurements, focusing on key parameters like ejection fraction and diastolic function. A network pharmacology approach identified active QLQX components and potential targets, followed by comprehensive multi-omics analyses-including transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics-to uncover the molecular mechanisms modulated by QLQX. Quantitative RT-PCR was employed to measure mRNA levels of key cardiac markers, providing further insights into QLQX's impact on cardiac remodeling. RESULTS: QLQX treatment significantly improved cardiac function, with notable enhancements in ejection fraction and left ventricular diastolic function. Network pharmacology revealed 530 potential targets of QLQX, with 38 overlapping HFpEF targets. Key pathways identified include cGMP-PKG, adrenergic signaling, and calcium signaling. Transcriptomic analysis showed significant gene expression changes related to inflammation, energy metabolism, and myocardial remodeling, which were reversed by QLQX. Proteomic analysis identified 401 differentially expressed proteins, enriched in pathways such as cGMP-PKG and NF-κB signaling. Metabolomic profiling highlighted the role of lipid metabolism and adrenergic signaling in HFpEF, which were normalized by QLQX.

The CAG rat model was built by the MNNG composite multi-factor method, followed by a 90-day administration of Xiangsha Liujunzi Decoction. The study measured the rat body mass and 3-hour food intake in each group and observed the pathological changes in gastric tissue using HE staining. It used RNA sequencing(RNA-Seq) to determine the gene expression in the gastric tissue of rats in each group and then analyzed differential genes through KEGG enrichment analysis to validate enriched key signaling pathways. The results indicated that the body mass and 3-hour food intake in the model group were significantly lower than those in the blank group, alongside typical signs of gastric tissue atrophy. In contrast, the treatment group exhibited a significant increase in body mass and 3-hour food intake and significant improvements in the damage of gastric tissue pathology. A total of 944 genes associated with the improvement of CAG by Xiangsha Liujunzi Decoction were obtained via RNA-Seq. KEGG enrichment analysis revealed that these genes were mainly enriched in multiple signal transduction pathways involving signaling pathways such as inflammation, proliferation, apoptosis, as well as cyclic adenosine monophosphate(cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphate(cGMP)/protein kinases(PKG) pathways. Compared to the blank group, the RNA-Seq results showed significant increases in adenosine A1 receptor recombina(Adora1) and BK channel subunit beta 3(Kcnmb2) mRNA expression in gastric tissue in the model group, while the expression of endothelin receptor type B gene(Ednrb), recombinant Rho associated coiled coil containing protein kinase 2(Rock2), cGMP-dependent protein kinase 2(Prkg2), and cAMP responsive element binding protein 3 like 3 gene(Creb3l3) mRNA was significantly decreased. Compared to the model group, the expression of Adora1 and Kcnmb2 mRNA in gastric tissue in the treatment group decreased significantly, while the expression of Ednrb, Rock2, Prkg2, and Creb3l3 mRNA increased significantly. Molecular biology experiments revealed significant decreases in cAMP content in gastric tissue and plasma, as well as decreased expression levels of Ras homolog gene family member A(RhoA), ROCK2, phospho-myosin phosphatase target subunit 1(p-MYPT1), and phospho-Myosin light chain(Ser20)(p-MLC20) proteins in gastric tissue in the model group, accompanied by significantly increased cGMP content in gastric tissue and plasma and significantly increased expression of PKG protein in gastric tissue. When the treatment group was compared with the model group, the results showed significant decreases in cGMP content in gastric tissue and plasma and PKG protein expression in gastric tissue, alongside increased expression le-vels of RhoA, ROCK2, p-MYPT1, and p-MLC20 in gastric tissue. At the same time, the results of RT-qPCR confirmed that the expression of key genes in the cGMP/PKG pathway was consistent with the RNA-Seq findings.

C5a/C5aR/ROS/NLRP3 and cGMP/PKG/mTOR axis in rats based on toxicological evidence chain (TEC) concept by phosphoproteomic analysis.", "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Podophyllotoxin (PPT), a highly active compound extracted from the rhizome of Dysosma versipellis (DV), has been used as an effective anti-cancer drug clinically since the 1950s. It possesses various biological activities, including antiviral and antitumor effects. However, its clinical application is severely limited due to its hepatotoxicity, and the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. This study aims to elucidate the mechanisms of PPT-induced hepatotoxicity using tandem quality tag (TMT) based quantitative proteomics and phosphoproteomics, providing potential targets and directions for developing new therapeutic strategies to facilitate the safe and rational use of podophyllotoxin in clinical settings. METHODS: We employed a comprehensive assessment of PPT-induced hepatotoxicity based on the Toxicology Evidence Chain (TEC) concept, originally proposed by our research group in 2018. This approach involves a tiered search for evidence of Harmful Ingredients Evidence (HIE), Injury Phenotype Evidence (IPE), Adverse Outcomes Evidence (AOE), and Toxic Events Evidence (TEE) during the development of PPT-induced hepatotoxicity, thereby constructing a guiding toxicology evidence chain. Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were administered 20 mg/kg PPT for 4 consecutive days (HIE). Indicators such as hepatic function, oxidative stress, inflammatory factors, as well as the histopathology of liver tissue were evaluated to assess liver damage and synthetic function (AOE). Proteomics and phosphoproteomics were conducted to systematically assess PPT-induced hepatotoxicity at the level of modified proteins and verify the molecular mechanisms of key molecular pathways (TEE1). Furthermore, in vitro THLE-2 cell models were used in conjunction with CCK8, immunofluorescence, and ELISA assays to validate cytotoxicity and its underlying mechanisms (TEE2). RESULTS: Our results showed that after 4 days of PPT administration at 20 mg/kg (HIE), serum levels of AST/ALT, TBA, TP, and ALB in SD rats were significantly increased (P < 0.05), indicating severe liver damage. SOD and T-AOC levels were significantly decreased (P < 0.05), suggesting an oxidative stress state. TNF-α levels were significantly elevated, while IL-10 and IL-3 levels were significantly reduced (P < 0.05), indicating strong activation of the inflammatory response in the liver. Histopathological examination revealed liver sinusoidal congestion in the liver tissue (AOE). Omics analysis revealed that hepatotoxicity primarily affected the complement-pyroptosis and cGMP-PKG-autophagy pathways. Western blot (WB) and RT-qPCR results showed significant upregulation of complement-pyroptosis pathway proteins (C5a, C5aR, NLRP3) and cGMP-PKG-autophagy pathway proteins (PKG, mTOR) in the PPT group (P < 0.05) (TEE1). In vitro cell experiments showed that PPT significantly reduced cell viability (P < 0.05) and increased the expression of proteins associated with pyroptosis and autophagy pathways, including ROS, NLRP3, PKG, and mTOR (P < 0.05) (TEE2). CONCLUSION: PPT activates the complement system through the C5a/C5aR/ROS/NLRP3 pathway and induces the formation of inflammasomes, promoting pyroptosis. Simultaneously, PPT activates the cGMP-PKG pathway, inhibiting autophagy and further accelerating pyroptosis, ultimately leading to hepatotoxicity. In conclusion, this study comprehensively revealed the underlying mechanisms of PPT-induced hepatotoxicity using the TEC concept. This approach transforms fragmented toxicity indicators into systematic evidence of toxicity, presenting a hierarchical progression of toxicity evidence and avoiding data accumulation in natural drug toxicology.

Transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) and transient receptor potential ankyrin type 1 (TRPA1) play major roles in transmitting nociceptive sensory signals in the nociceptive primary sensory dorsal root ganglion (DRG) nerve. The nitric oxide (NO)/cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate(cGMP) pathway exerts both nociceptive and antinociceptive effects in various chronic pain models. TRPV1 and TRPA1 mediate the influx of calcium, which stimulates the generation of NO. Subsequently, NO activates the NO/cGMP/protein kinase G (PKG) signaling pathway, thereby improving hyperalgesia. In the present study, oa rat model of NP with minor chronic constriction injury (CCI) of the right sciatic nerve of NP was established. The results of behavioral testing showed that, after a one-time tuina intervention, the mechanical withdrawal threshold (MWT) and thermal withdrawal latency (TWL) were prolonged to varying degrees in the tuina group compared with the model group.

{"id": "rno05016", "name": "Huntington disease - Rattus norvegicus (rat)", "description": "Huntington disease (HD) is an autosomal-dominant neurodegenerative disorder that primarily affects medium spiny striatal neurons (MSN). The symptoms are choreiform, involuntary movements, personality changes and dementia. HD is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the IT15 gene, which results in a long stretch of polyglutamine (polyQ) close to the amino-terminus of the HD protein huntingtin (Htt). Mutant Htt (mHtt) has effects both in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus. Full-length huntingtin is cleaved by proteases in the cytoplasm, leading to the formation of cytoplasmic and neuritic aggregates. mHtt also alters vesicular transport and recycling, causes cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca2+  overload, triggers endoplasmic reticulum stress through proteasomal dysfunction, and impairs autophagy function, increasing neuronal death susceptibility. N-terminal fragments containing the polyQ strech translocate to the nucleus where they impair transcription and induce neuronal death.", "genes": ["100188937"], "pubmed": [{"pmid": "40956543", "title": "Neuroprotective effects of candesartan in 3-nitropropionic acid-induced Huntington's disease: modulation of angiotensin and CREB/BDNF/PGC1-α signaling.", "abstract": "Renin-Angiotensin System has been implicated in neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's (HD).

Rats received Candesartan (2.5 or 5 mg/kg) for 14 days, after which brain and striatum were isolated for the histopathological, immunohistochemical, and biochemical analysis. Cand displayed significant improvement in the rats' behavioral tests, enhancing their memory, motor, and cognitive functions induced by 3NP, which was confirmed by the striatal histopathological and immunohistochemical examination of the GFAP. In addition, Cand activated the Ang II/AT2R/Ang-(1-7)/Mas receptor axis. Moreover, Cand stimulated the production of striatal neurotrophic proteins CREB/BDNF/PGC1-α which in turn decreased the levels of inflammatory mediators NF-κB and IL-1β, accompanied by an increase in the antioxidants NQO1 and HO-1 levels.

Oxytocin reversed the detrimental effects of 3-NP on the striatum, which was evidenced by improvement of motor behavior, as well as histological picture and neurochemical balance. Oxytocin markedly reduced striatal calpain-2 and p25 Cdk5 protein expressions and increased the endogenous calpain inhibitor, calpastatin expression along with the pro-survival factor, myocyte-enhancer factor 2 (MEF-2) contents. Moreover, it suppressed striatal content of the pro-apoptotic biomarkers (BCl-2-associated X protein (Bax), tumor suppressor protein (p53), and caspase-3) and elevated striatal anti-apoptotic B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 2 (BCl-2) content. It repressed the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) to hinder caspase-dependent and caspase-independent apoptotic neuronal death. Oxytocin could be a promising candidate for HD management by hampering both mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial apoptosis through inhibition of calpain-2/p25 Cdk5/MEF-2 pathway.", "authors": "Rabie M; El-Tanbouly DM; Kandil EA; Sayed HM", "fulltext_url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/s11064-025-04397-9", "keywords": "Huntington disease[MeSH Terms] AND rat[MeSH Terms]", "llm_relevance_assessment": {"relevance_score": 9, "relevance_level": "High", "species_check": "The pathway is in Rattus norvegicus (rat), and the study uses rats as the experimental model, ensuring full species alignment.", "evidence_summary": "Oxytocin reversed the detrimental effects of 3-NP on the striatum...

Hence, this research aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effect of arbutin against HD using in silico, in vitro, and in vivo experimental approaches. Schrodinger software was used for the in-silico studies, while SH-SY5Y cells were used for in-vitro studies. In the in vivo studies, adult Wistar rats were divided into five groups and 3-nitro propionic acid (3-NPA) (10 mg/kg/day,i.p) alone, and with arbutin (50 and 100 mg/kg/day,i.p.) was administered for 21 days. The body weight and behavioral parameters, including locomotor activity and motor coordination, were assessed on the 1st, 7th, 14th & 21st days. On the 22nd day, animals were sacrificed; the striatum was harvested for biochemical, neurochemical, and histopathological assessment. In silico, results indicated that arbutin showed a good binding affinity for target proteins like Akt and Nrf2. Further, arbutin prevented cell death and oxidative stress in SH-SY5Y cells induced by 3-NPA. In addition, arbutin ameliorated the 3-NPA induced motor impairments, purine nucleoside imbalances (adenosine levels and its metabolites hypoxanthine, xanthine, adenine), oxidative stress, and histological alterations in the experimental animals.

Biochemical parameters were analyzed 2 h and 24 h after the procedure. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: it was found that the activity of cathepsin L did not change in any of the animal groups, while the activities of cathepsins B and H significantly increased. Inhalation had the greatest effect on cathepsin H, which increased by 1.6-6.4 times in different groups, and the reaction of young animals was more intense.

cardiomyocyte enlargement, fibrosis, cardiomyocyte apoptosis and impaired cardiac function. Rab26, a small GTPase, plays a crucial role in vesicle trafficking, secretion and apoptosis. However, its role in myocardial hypertrophy and cardiac remodeling remains unclear. METHODS: Transverse aortic constriction (TAC) model was employed to induce myocardial hypertrophy and cardiac remodeling, with functional and histological assessments. Cardiac-specific Rab26 overexpression was achieved via AAV9-cTnT-Rab26 delivery, while Rab26 knockout was used for loss-of-function analysis. Molecular mechanisms were explored using protein interaction studies, fluorescence co-localization, and protease inhibition assays. RESULTS: Our findings indicated a significant downregulation of Rab26 protein expression in the disease model, while its mRNA levels remained unaltered. Notably, cardiac-specific overexpression of Rab26 led to improved cardiac function, decreased cardiac fibrosis, suppressed myocardial hypertrophy and cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Furthermore, the knockout of Rab26 aggravated myocardial hypertrophy and cardiac remodeling. At the mechanistic level, Rab26 facilitates lysosomal translocation and degradation of eEF1A. Additionally, eEF1A silencing eliminated the protective effect of Rab26 on the heart. Comprehensive evaluation revealed the critical role of the Rab26-eEF1A axis in mediating pathological myocardial hypertrophy and cardiac remodeling.

This study investigates the underlying mechanisms of ATB-DILI, focusing on reactive oxygen species (ROS), mitophagy, lysosomal function, and the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) signaling pathway. A rat hepatocyte model treated with standard anti-TB drugs was established to assess liver inflammation, oxidative stress biomarkers, mitochondrial function, and mitophagy processes. The results indicate that anti-TB drug administration induced significant inflammatory injury, characterized by elevated IL-6 and reduced IL-4 and IL-10 levels.

Pharmacological intervention with mitoTEMPO alleviated mitochondrial dysfunction, while clioquinol restored lysosomal function and improved mitophagy.

Phillygenin (PHI), a bioactive compound isolated from Forsythia suspensa, has been found to confer various pharmacological properties, including anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective, and renal protective effects. However, the specific role of PHI in MI/RI remains largely unclear. Thus, this study aims to investigate whether PHI exerted cardioprotective effects against MI/RI, and if so, to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Hypoxia/reoxygenation (H/R) models in H9c2 cardiomyocytes and MI/RI mouse models were established. PHI intervention markedly improved cardiac function, reduced myocardial infarct size, and attenuated cardiomyocyte damage in MI/RI mice. PHI treatment significantly reversed H/R-induced cellular injury and mitochondrial dysfunction in cultured cardiomyocytes. Notably, PHI administration significantly mitigated myocardial cuproptosis, rather than pyroptosis and ferroptosis. Specifically, PHI reduced cardiomyocyte cuproptosis by downregulating the protein expression of ferredoxin 1 (FDX1) and lipoyl synthase (LIAS), and suppressing copper accumulation. Induction of cuproptosis abolished the cardiac benefits of PHI in vivo and in vitro. Mechanistically, PHI promoted the lysosomal localization and degradation of the copper transporter 1 (CTR1), thus alleviating cuproptosis, inflammation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial injury in cardiomyocytes.

and RAAS dysregulation: implications for innate immune responses.", "abstract": "The potential for early life air pollutant exposure to result in later onset respiratory disease in children and adults is an emerging public health concern. Fetal growth restriction (FGR) and childhood respiratory infections are associated with impaired lung function in adulthood, and later in life, death from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). We previously showed that early gestational exposure of rats to the oxidant air pollutant, ozone, resulted in asymmetrical FGR and lung developmental delays. Herein, we investigate effects of early gestational, periadolescent, and combined ozone exposure on offspring health, lung injury, antioxidant reserve, and innate immune responses. Results revealed similar ozone effects in all offspring irrespective of exposure timing in terms of minor weight loss, reduced body temperature (1.5-2.0°C), and moderate lung injury. Lung injury was inversely correlated with lung antioxidant capacity. Progeny of ozone-exposed dams (i.e., FGR-prone offspring) showed greater variability in ventilatory responses (EF<sub>50</sub>, Penh) and increased Penh correlated with greater lung injury. FGR-prone offspring had more variable, often blunted immunoinflammatory responses to subsequent ozone exposure. Enhanced expression for antioxidant (Nrf2-related or ARE) genes were observed in FGR-prone males, whereas decreased expression for hypoxia (Hif-related or HRE) and RAAS genes (<i>Ace</i>, <i>Agtr1</i>, and <i>Ace2</i>) was observed in FGR-prone females, potentially suggesting that cross talk between redox transcription factors, Hif/RAAS, NF-κB, and Nrf2 led to differential responses. Collectively, these findings indicate that early life oxidant air pollutant exposure and resultant redox and RAAS dysregulation may impact both lung development and innate immune responses in a sex-dependent manner, effects that may increase vulnerability to respiratory infections.<b>NEW & NOTEWORTHY</b> This research investigates exposure factors and potential mechanisms contributing both to FGR and altered innate immune responses, effects that may impair lung function, limit immunity to respiratory pathogens, and perpetuate lung disease risk across the life span.

Here, we combined transcriptome-wide crosslinking immunoprecipitation (CLIP-seq), RNA-seq, and quantitative proteomics in cell culture and rat and human hearts to examine how RBM20 regulates alternative splicing in the heart. Our analyses revealed the presence of a distinct RBM20 RNA-recognition element that is predominantly found within intronic binding sites and linked to repression of exon splicing with RBM20 binding near 3' and 5' splice sites. Proteomic analysis determined that RBM20 interacts with both U1 and U2 small nuclear ribonucleic particles (snRNPs) and suggested that RBM20-dependent splicing repression occurs through spliceosome stalling at complex A. Direct RBM20 targets included several genes previously shown to be involved in DCM as well as genes not typically associated with this disease. In failing human hearts, reduced expression of RBM20 affected alternative splicing of several direct targets, indicating that differences in RBM20 expression may affect cardiac function.

Introns must be removed with nucleotidal precision, since even a single nucleotide mistake would result in a reading frame shift and production of a non-functional protein. Numerous human inherited diseases are caused by mutations that affect splicing, including mutations in proteins which are directly involved in splicing catalysis.

While the majority of mutated genes are expressed specifically in the retina, eight target genes encode for ubiquitous core snRNP proteins (Prpf3, Prpf4, Prpf6, Prpf8, Prpf31, and SNRNP200/Brr2) and splicing factors (RP9 and DHX38).

This form is particularly apparent in acute liver injury, where it has been shown that sinusoidal endothelial cells produce EIIIA-fibronectin. This fibronectin isoform arises by alternative splicing of the primary transcript. In the present experiments, we have studied the regulation of fibronectin splicing in primary sinusoidal endothelial cells by transfecting a minigene containing the EIIIA exon and its flanking introns, driven by various promoters. The results indicate that fibronectin splicing in endothelial cells from normal liver is in part promoter-dependent. However, in cells from injured liver in which expression of both total and EIIIA-fibronectin is strikingly increased, promoter effects disappear. Because fibronectin splicing is known to be regulated in part by TGFbeta, we also examined the effect of a soluble inhibitor of the TGFbeta type 2 receptor. This agent had no effect on splicing by normal endothelial cells. By contrast, for endothelial cells from the injured liver, the splicing pattern reverted to that of normal cells, i.e., it became promoter-dependent.

Ferroptosis is a recently identified form of iron-dependent, lipid peroxidation-mediated cell death, and is closely associated with mitochondrial function. While ferroptosis has been implicated in several neurological diseases, its role in VCI remains poorly understood. In this study, we investigated how modulating ferroptosis (ferrostatin-1), mitochondrial fission (Mdivi-1), and Nrf-2 (ML385) affected HT22 cells subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) via the measurement of ROS and caspase-3 levels. A rat model of VCI, induced by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion, was used to assess the effects of Mdivi-1 and ML385 on cognitive function (Morris water maze), neuronal apoptosis, ferroptosis, and the expression of mitochondrial fission-/fusion-related proteins (immunofluorescence and western blotting). Neural damage in the hippocampus and cortex was evaluated via hematoxylin and eosin staining. Mitochondrial ultrastructure and ROS levels were examined by transmission electron microscopy and dihydroethidium staining, respectively. Molecular docking was used to analyze Mdivi-1/Nrf-2 interaction. In vitro, ferrostatin-1 and Mdivi-1 reduced OGD-induced ROS accumulation and apoptosis, whereas ML385 exacerbated these effects. In vivo, Mdivi-1 improved VCI by reducing cortical injury, hippocampal apoptosis, and mitochondrial ultrastructural damage. This was achieved by inhibiting DRP1-dependent mitochondrial fission, promoting MFN1/2 expression, and activating Nrf-2/HO-1/GPX4 signaling, thereby suppressing oxidative stress and ferroptosis. However, ML385 reversed these effects. Molecular docking studies supported a direct interaction between Mdivi-1 and Nrf-2.

Although orexin-A (OXA) attenuates TBI-induced ferroptosis and functional impairment, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. We investigated whether OXA exerts neuroprotection via the orexin receptor 1 (OX1R)/nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway through in vitro and in vivo experiments. Rat TBI models were induced by modified Feeney's method alongside Erastin-treated PC12 ferroptosis models.

Pathological and molecular evaluations included Evans blue staining, hematoxylin-eosin staining, Fluoro-Jade B staining, CCK-8 assay, cell migration assays, transmission electron microscopy, biochemical assays, Western blot, quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and immunofluorescence. In the TBI rat model, OXA administration significantly reduced mNSS scores, prolonged grip latency in the IST, and attenuated blood-brain barrier disruption and neuronal damage. OXA suppressed oxidative stress, upregulated OX1R and HO-1 protein expression, elevated ferroptosis-related markers (SLC7A11 and GPX4), and promoted the nuclear translocation of Nrf2.

METHOD: We established an epileptic rat model and intervened with BoNT/A to assess its influence on cognitive functions and the pathological damage of hippocampal tissues. Rat hippocampal neuronal cells were treated with magnesium-free induction solution to establish an epileptic cell model and intervened using BoNT/A. Changes in ferrous ions (Fe<sup>2+</sup>), malondialdehyde (MDA), and glutathione (GSH) were detected in hippocampal tissues and cells. Western blot (WB) and RT-qPCR were used to detect the protein expression of the iron death markers, including GPX4, ACSL4, and SLC7A11. FINDING: We found that BoNT/A attenuated epileptiform behavior and cognitive deficits and ameliorated hippocampal tissue damage in rats under lithium chloride-pilocarpine-induced epilepsy. In vitro BoNT/A treatment exerted potent neuroprotective effects on hippocampal neuronal cells treated by magnesium-free induction solution.

It is also required for normal sperm development; thus, it has been identified as a 'moonlighting' protein because of its ability to serve dual functions as a peroxidase, as well as a structural protein in mature spermatozoa. Disruption of this gene in mouse spermatocytes is associated with male infertility. This isozyme is also a selenoprotein, containing the rare amino acid selenocysteine (Sec) at its active site. Sec is encoded by the UGA codon, which normally signals translation termination. The 3' UTRs of selenoprotein mRNAs contain a conserved stem-loop structure, designated the Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element, that is necessary for the recognition of UGA as a Sec codon, rather than as a stop signal. Transcript variants resulting from alternative splicing or use of alternate promoters have been described to encode isoforms with different subcellular localization. Pseudogenes of this locus have been identified on chromosomes 1, 10 and 14.

Secondary nerve injury can cause nerve cell ferroptosis (FER), which promotes oxidative stress and inflammatory response and has been associated with poor prognosis in patients. Chrysin (CHR) has various bioactivities, such as antioxidative stress, anti-inflammatory, anti-FER, and neuroprotective effects. However, the role and mechanism of CHR in ICH remain undetermined. Therefore, this study established the rat ICH model using an autologous blood injection to investigate the brain tissue and hippocampal neuron morphological changes via hematoxylin-eosin staining, Nissl staining, and transmission electron microscopy. Furthermore, FER-related indicators were detected using a reagent kit and western blotting. Moreover, the Morris water maze test was carried out to assess the cognitive function of rats. The results indicated that CHR treatment significantly reduced FER, oxidative stress, inflammation, and nerve injury in the hippocampus of ICH rats and improved their cognitive function. In addition, ML385, the Nrf2 inhibitor, reversed the CHR-induced upregulation of the Nrf2/GPX4 signaling pathway and aggravated cognitive dysfunction in ICH rats. In conclusion, this study indicated that CHR inhibits FER by regulating the Nrf2/GPX4 signaling pathway to alleviate nerve injury and improve cognitive dysfunction in ICH rats.

Recent studies have identified ferroptosis as a significant pathological mechanism in SCI. SIRT2, a deacetylase enzyme, is closely associated with inflammatory responses and apoptosis, playing a crucial role in the pathogenesis of various neurological disorders. This research aims to elucidate the specific mechanisms by which SIRT2 overexpression inhibits ferroptosis and promotes SCI repair through the deacetylation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p65. RESULTS: Utilizing cell models and a rat SCI model, we discovered that SIRT2 overexpression promotes NF-κB p65 deacetylation, subsequently inhibiting ferroptosis and oxidative stress. Conversely, the use of AK-7 elevated NF-κB p65 acetylation levels, exacerbating ferroptosis and oxidative stress. In SCI rats, intrathecal injection of SIRT2-overexpressing recombinant adenovirus successfully inhibited NF-κB p65 acetylation and ferroptosis in the dorsal root ganglia, thereby reducing neuronal apoptosis and enhancing motor function recovery. CONCLUSION: In summary, these findings indicate that SIRT2 overexpression can suppress ferroptosis through NF-κB p65 deacetylation, facilitating SCI repair.
