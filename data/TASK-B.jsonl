After sequential addition of monosaccharides by ALG glycosyltransferases [MD:M00055], the N-glycan precursor is attached by the OST (oligosaccharyltransferase) complex to the polypeptide chain that is being synthesized and translocated through the ER membrane. The protein-bound N-glycan precursor is subsequently trimmed, extended, and modified in the ER and Golgi by a complex series of reactions catalyzed by membrane-bound glycosidases and glycosyltransferases. N-glycans thus synthesized are classified into three types: high-mannose type, complex type, and hybrid type. Defects in N-glycan biosynthesis lead to a variety of human diseases known as congenital disorders of glycosylation [DS:H00118 H00119].\n\nIn the context of this pathway, the following biological alterations were observed:\n**Observed Entities**: Mannose 6-phosphate, IDUA (administration), M6PR.\n\nBased on the pathway context and biological principles, generate a coherent mechanism analysis explaining how these entities interact to produce the observed phenotype."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Mannose 6-phosphate-containing N-glycans facilitate lysosomal targeting by binding to mannose 6-phosphate receptors, which mediate endocytosis and lysosomal delivery of glycoproteins.

On the other hand, human-type ES/iPS cells, which are in need of Activin and FGF signaling, are termed 'primed state'.

AD is associated with senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Amyloid-beta (Abeta), a major component of senile plaques, has various pathological effects on cell and organelle function. To date genetic studies have revealed four genes that may be linked to autosomal dominant or familial early onset AD (FAD). These four genes include: amyloid precursor protein (APP), presenilin 1 (PS1), presenilin 2 (PS2) and apolipoprotein E (ApoE). All mutations associated with APP and PS proteins can lead to an increase in the production of Abeta peptides, specfically the more amyloidogenic form, Abeta42.

Some of the constituents of focal adhesions participate in the structural link between membrane receptors and the actin cytoskeleton, while others are signalling molecules, including different protein kinases and phosphatases, their substrates, and various adapter proteins. Integrin signaling is dependent upon the non-receptor tyrosine kinase activities of the FAK and src proteins as well as the adaptor protein functions of FAK, src and Shc to initiate downstream signaling events. These signalling events culminate in reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton; a prerequisite for changes in cell shape and motility, and gene expression. Similar morphological alterations and modulation of gene expression are initiated by the binding of growth factors to their respective receptors, emphasizing the considerable crosstalk between adhesion- and growth factor-mediated signalling.\n\nIn the context of this pathway, the following biological alterations were observed:\n**Observed Entities**: 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine, TNIK, RHOA, ROCK2 (activation), LIMK1 (activation), F-actin (organization), tubulin (organization).\n\nBased on the pathway context and biological principles, generate a coherent mechanism analysis explaining how these entities interact to produce the observed phenotype."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "TNIK regulates the organization of F-actin and microtubules through the RHO/ROCK2/LIMK1 signaling pathway, which controls focal adhesion turnover and mitosis.

At AJs, E-cadherin serves as an essential cell adhesion molecules (CAMs). The cytoplasmic tail binds beta-catenin, which in turn binds alpha-catenin. Alpha-catenin is associated with F-actin bundles directly and indirectly. The integrity of the cadherin-catenin complex is negatively regulated by phosphorylation of beta-catenin by receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases (Fer, Fyn, Yes, and Src), which leads to dissociation of the cadherin-catenin complex. Integrity of this complex is positively regulated by beta -catenin phosphorylation by casein kinase II, and dephosphorylation by protein tyrosine phosphatases. Changes in the phosphorylation state of beta-catenin affect cell-cell adhesion, cell migration and the level of signaling beta-catenin. Wnt signaling acts as a positive regulator of beta-catenin by inhibiting beta-catenin degradation, which stabilizes beta-catenin, and causes its accumulation. Cadherin may acts as a negative regulator of signaling beta-catenin as it binds beta-catenin at the cell surface and thereby sequesters it from the nucleus. Nectins also function as CAMs at AJs, but are more highly concentrated at AJs than E-cadherin. Nectins transduce signals through Cdc42 and Rac, which reorganize the actin cytoskeleton, regulate the formation of AJs, and strengthen cell-cell adhesion.\n\nIn the context of this pathway, the following biological alterations were observed:\n**Observed Entities**: Gsk 10116790A, GI254023X, TRPV4 (activation), E-cadherin, ADAM10.\n\nBased on the pathway context and biological principles, generate a coherent mechanism analysis explaining how these entities interact to produce the observed phenotype."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "TRPV4 channel activation induces calcium influx, which stimulates ADAM10-mediated cleavage of E-cadherin, resulting in the formation of a ~35 kDa C-terminal fragment and a reduction in alveolar epithelial barrier integrity.

Step 1 involves the development of an inflammatory milieu resulting from damage in the host tissues induced by the preparative chemotherapy or radiotherapy regimen. Damaged tissues secrete inflammatory cytokines, including interleukin 1 (IL-1), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-alpha ). During step 2, antigen-presenting cells (APCs) trigger the activation of donor-derived T cells, which induce further T-cell expansion, induce cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and natural killer (NK) cells responses and prime additional mononuclear phagocytes to produce TNF-alpha and IL-1. Also, nitric oxide (NO) is produced by activated macrophages, and it may contribute to the tissue damage seen during step 3. During step 3, the effector phase, activated CTL and NK cells mediate cytotoxicity against target host cells through Fas-Fas ligand interactions and perforin-granzyme B.\n\nIn the context of this pathway, the following biological alterations were observed:\n**Observed Entities**: Semaglutide (administration), Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor.\n\nBased on the pathway context and biological principles, generate a coherent mechanism analysis explaining how these entities interact to produce the observed phenotype."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Allogeneic T cells homing to the gut express a functional Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R), as evidenced by the induction of Glp1r mRNA transcripts in the ileum.

N-glycans are covalently attached to asparagine with the consensus sequence of Asn-X-Ser/Thr by an N-glycosidic bond, GlcNAc b1- Asn. Biosynthesis of N-glycans begins on the cytoplasmic face of the ER membrane with the transferase reaction of UDP-GlcNAc and the lipid-like precursor P-Dol (dolichol phosphate) to generate GlcNAc a1- PP-Dol. After sequential addition of monosaccharides by ALG glycosyltransferases [MD:M00055], the N-glycan precursor is attached by the OST (oligosaccharyltransferase) complex to the polypeptide chain that is being synthesized and translocated through the ER membrane. The protein-bound N-glycan precursor is subsequently trimmed, extended, and modified in the ER and Golgi by a complex series of reactions catalyzed by membrane-bound glycosidases and glycosyltransferases. N-glycans thus synthesized are classified into three types: high-mannose type, complex type, and hybrid type.

It is capable of degrading a variety of cellular proteins in a rapid and timely fashion and most substrate proteins are modified by ubiquitin before their degradation by the proteasome. The proteasome is a large protein complex consisting of a proteolytic core called the 20S particle and ancillary factors that regulate its activity in various ways. The most common form is the 26S proteasome containing one 20S core particle and two 19S regulatory particles that enable the proteasome to degrade ubiquitinated proteins by an ATP-dependent mechanism. Another form is the immunoproteasome containing two 11S regulatory particles, PA28 alpha and PA28 beta, which are induced by interferon gamma under the conditions of intensified immune response. Other regulatory particles include PA28 gamma and PA200. Although PA28 gamma also belongs to a family of activators of the 20S proteasome, it is localized within the nucleus and forms a homoheptamer. PA28 gamma has been implicated in the regulation of cell cycle progression and apoptosis.

Moreover, trafficking of apical GLUT2 is rapidly up-regulated by glucose and artificial sweeteners, which act through T1R2 + T1R3/alpha-gustducin to activate PLC-beta2 and PKC-beta II. Fructose is transported separately by the brush border GLUT5 and then released out of the enterocyte into the blood by GLUT2.\n\nIn the context of this pathway, the following biological alterations were observed:\n**Observed Entities**: D-Fructose, (+)-Lactose, CID 91333377, SGLT1, GLUT2.\n\nBased on the pathway context and biological principles, generate a coherent mechanism analysis explaining how these entities interact to produce the observed phenotype."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Fructose competes with glucose for transport via SGLT1 and GLUT2, thereby reducing the intestinal absorption of glucose-dependent drugs.
