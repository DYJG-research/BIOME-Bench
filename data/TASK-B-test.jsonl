{"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": "**Pathway Name**: Bladder cancer - Homo sapiens (human)\n**Pathway Description**: The urothelium covers the luminal surface of almost the entire urinary tract, extending from the renal pelvis, through the ureter and bladder, to the proximal urethra. The majority of urothelial carcinoma are bladder carcinomas, and urothelial carcinomas of the renal pelvis and ureter account for only approximately 7% of the total. Urothelial tumours arise and evolve through divergent phenotypic pathways. Some tumours progress from urothelial hyperplasia to low-grade non-invasive superficial papillary tumours. More aggressive variants arise either from flat, high-grade carcinoma in situ (CIS) and progress to invasive tumours, or they arise de novo as invasive tumours. Low-grade papillary tumors frequently show a constitutive activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase-Ras pathway, exhibiting activating mutations in the HRAS and fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) genes. In contrast, CIS and invasive tumors frequently show alterations in the TP53 and RB genes and pathways. Invasion and metastases are promoted by several factors that alter the tumour microenvironment, including the aberrant expression of E-cadherins (E-cad), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).\n\nIn the context of this pathway, the following biological alterations were observed:\n**Observed Entities**: SIGLEC12 (elevated expression), arginine at position 122 of SIGLEC12, E-cadherin, matrix metalloproteinases, vascular endothelial growth factor, HRAS, fibroblast growth factor receptor 3, TP53, RB1.\n\nBased on the pathway context and biological principles, generate a coherent mechanism analysis explaining how these entities interact to produce the observed phenotype."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Elevated expression of SIGLEC12 in bladder cancer correlates with increased immune cell infiltration and upregulation of oncogenic and immune checkpoint-related genes. This expression is associated with drug resistance signatures and occurs independently of tumor stage or metastatic status. SIGLEC12 lacks the canonical R122 residue but retains structural integrity, suggesting potential functional roles in sialic acid recognition. In bladder cancer, alterations in TP53 and RB1 genes contribute to invasive tumor progression, while HRAS and FGFR3 mutations are linked to low-grade papillary tumors. E-cadherin loss and MMP activity facilitate tumor invasion, and VEGF promotes angiogenesis, further supporting tumor growth and metastasis."}], "pathway_id": "hsa05219", "pubmed_id": "41303731", "species": "hsa"}
