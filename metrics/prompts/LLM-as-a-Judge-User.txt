# Task Data

## 1. Multi-Omics Pathway Mechanism Elucidation Question
{query}

## 2. Target Processes & Phenotypes (Hidden Goals)
*The model was expected to derive the following outcomes based on the drivers (used for "Phenotype Coverage" scoring):*
{target_phenotypes_str}

## 4. Reference Answer (Ground Truth)
{ground_truth_text}

## 5. Model Output (Prediction to Evaluate)
{model_prediction_text}

# Evaluation Instruction
Please evaluate the **Model Output** based on the System Prompt's rubric.

**Step-by-step procedure:**
1. **Check Coverage**: Did the model mention the concepts listed in "Target Processes & Phenotypes"?
2. **Check Logic**: Is there a causal chain connecting "Input Drivers" to these phenotypes?
3. **Check Factuality**: Are the interaction directions (activate/inhibit) consistent with the "Reference Answer"?
4. **Check Hallucination**: Did the model invent entities NOT listed in "Input Drivers" or "Pathway Context"?

**Output**: Provide the JSON object with the "critique" and "scores".
