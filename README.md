## 🌟 Overview

**BIOME-Bench** is a literature-grounded evaluation framework for assessing large language models on two core capabilities:

* **Biomolecular Interaction Inference (BII)**
* **End-to-end Multi-Omics Pathway Mechanism Elucidation (MPME)**

Multi-omics profiling, including proteomics, metabolomics, and single-cell transcriptomics, has become central to studying complex biological systems and disease mechanisms. In practice, researchers often rely on **Pathway Enrichment Analysis** to interpret coordinated molecular changes across regulatory layers, as illustrated below:

<div align="center">
  <img src="./imgs/pathway_analysis_pipeline.svg" width="48% biological-atom" />
</div>

However, this enrichment-based workflow faces several persistent bottlenecks:

1. **Curation Lag**: Pathway knowledgebases are curated and versioned, which can delay incorporation of newly discovered or context-specific mechanisms.
2. **Functional Redundancy**: Enrichment results frequently contain heavily overlapping gene sets, producing long lists of near-duplicate pathways that are difficult to prioritize.
3. **Context-insensitivity**: Enrichment scores are largely context-agnostic. They do not represent molecular states (e.g., phosphorylation or activation), intervention directionality, or the multi-hop causal structure required to connect perturbed entities to pathway-level phenotypes.

Recent advances in large language models offer opportunities to improve pathway-centric interpretation, for example by reducing redundancy and generating mechanistic narratives. Yet progress remains difficult to measure because there is still **no standardized benchmark that evaluates end-to-end mechanistic elucidation**—namely, whether a model can directly infer a coherent, causally grounded **mechanistic chain** from **multi-omics perturbation observations**, conditioned on pathway context.

**BIOME-Bench** addresses this gap. Given **observed perturbed entities** and a **pathway context**, it requires models to generate coherent, state-aware, intervention-consistent mechanistic explanation.

The figure below shows the core workflow used to construct BIOME-Bench from the literature:

## 🏗️ Data Construction

BIOME-Bench transforms pathway information and literature evidence into a structured, validated knowledge representation through four stages:

### Phase I: Literature Retrieval and Relevance Filtering

To ensure strong biological validity, the construction process begins with a rigorous literature acquisition stage. Let

$$
\mathcal{P} = \lbrace p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n \rbrace
$$

denote a predefined set of target KEGG pathways. Each pathway $p_i$ is characterized by its pathway name $N_{p_i}$ and associated species $S_{p_i}$.

#### MeSH-guided Literature Retrieval

For each pathway $p_i$, we perform a structured literature search on the PubMed database using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)  to improve recall precision and semantic consistency. Specifically, the pathway name $N_{p_i}$ is mapped to a set of MeSH descriptors, denoted as $\mathrm{MeSH}(N_{p_i})$, and the species $S_{p_i}$ is mapped to the corresponding MeSH organism term, denoted as $\mathrm{MeSH}(S_{p_i})$.

The final PubMed query is constructed as a conjunction of pathway-related MeSH terms and species constraints:

$$
Q(p_i) = \mathrm{MeSH}(N_{p_i}) \wedge \mathrm{MeSH}(S_{p_i}).
$$

Executing $Q(p_i)$ yields an initial candidate document set:

$$
D_{\text{candidate}}(p_i) = \lbrace d_1, d_2, \dots, d_m \rbrace,
$$

where each document $d_j$ is indexed by PubMed and annotated with curated MeSH terms.

#### LLM-based Semantic and Mechanistic Relevance Scoring

MeSH-guided retrieval yields a controlled, high-recall candidate set, but MeSH annotations alone do not ensure that an article contains pathway-specific mechanistic evidence. To identify literature suitable for mechanism-level benchmarking, we use an LLM-based semantic evaluator with parameters $\theta$.

Given a document and pathway pair $(d, p_i)$, the evaluator assigns a relevance score

$$
s = f_{\theta}(d, p_i), \quad s \in [0,10],
$$

where $f_{\theta}$ aggregates multiple biologically motivated dimensions:

$$
f_{\theta}(d, p_i)=g_{\theta}(\mathbf{S}),
\qquad
\mathbf{S}=
\begin{bmatrix}
S_{\text{subj}}\\
S_{\text{spec}}\\
S_{\text{mol}}\\
S_{\text{ctx}}
\end{bmatrix}.
$$

- $S_{\text{subj}}$ measures whether the pathway’s biological process is the primary focus of the article, as opposed to a background mention.
- $S_{\text{spec}}$ measures whether the organism studied matches the pathway species. It also credits appropriate model organisms used to study human physiology or disease while penalizing biologically unrelated species.
- $S_{\text{mol}}$ measures whether the article mentions pathway-defined molecular entities, such as genes, enzymes, or metabolites.
- $S_{\text{ctx}}$ measures whether the article describes pathway regulation, such as activation, inhibition, or other modulatory effects, rather than merely reporting pathway presence.

We retain a document only if it exceeds a strict relevance threshold:

$$
D_{\text{relevant}}(p_i)=\lbrace d \in D_{\text{candidate}}(p_i) \mid f_{\theta}(d,p_i)\ge \alpha \rbrace.
$$


In this work, we set $\alpha = 8$ to prioritize articles in which the target pathway is central and supported by explicit molecular and regulatory evidence.

------

### Phase II: Information Extraction and Entity Standardization

#### LLM-based Mechanistic Extraction

For each document $d \in D_{\text{relevant}}(p_i)$, we process the abstract using a LLM to produce two complementary outputs:

1. **Raw Entity Set** $E_{\text{raw}}$: a collection of mentioned biological entities categorized into Chemicals, Genes/Proteins, and Phenotypes.
2. **Mechanism Description** $M_{\text{text}}$: a coherent natural language explanation describing the molecular interactions and regulatory mechanisms reported in the document. This text later serves as ground truth for generative evaluation.

#### Entity Normalization and Ontology Mapping

To ensure interoperability with external biological resources, we normalize each raw entity $e \in E_{\text{raw}}$ to a canonical identifier using an ontology resolution function $\phi(e)$. Specifically:

- **Chemical entities** are mapped to PubChem compound identifiers (CIDs) using PubChemPy.
- **Genes and proteins** are mapped to NCBI Gene identifiers or UniProt accessions via MyGene.info.

To improve benchmark quality, we discard a candidate document if any entity cannot be resolved to a valid identifier. Only documents for which all entities are successfully normalized are retained, yielding the standardized entity set:

$$
E_{\text{std}}=\left\lbrace \phi(e)\mid e\in E_{\text{raw}} \wedge \forall e'\in E_{\text{raw}},\ \phi(e')\neq\emptyset \right\rbrace
$$

------

### Phase III: Knowledge Structuring and Validation

This phase converts extracted mechanistic information into a fine-grained, state-aware knowledge graph representation.

#### Interaction Quadruple Extraction

We first extract the core interaction structure from $M_{\text{text}}$. Each interaction is represented as a quadruple:

$$
T_{\text{core}} = (e_s, r, e_t, c),
$$

where $e_s, e_t \in E_{\text{std}}$ denote the source and target entities, $r \in \mathcal{R}$ is a relation type drawn from a controlled biological vocabulary, and $c$ specifies the biological condition under which the interaction occurs.

#### Biological State Annotation

To capture dynamic molecular behavior, we further annotate entity-specific biological states. Let $\sigma_s$ and $\sigma_t$ denote the states of the source and target entities, respectively (e.g., mutated, overexpressed). Incorporating state information yields a state-aware hexaplet representation:

$$
T_{\text{final}} = (e_s, \sigma_s, r, e_t, \sigma_t, c).
$$

This formulation enables the benchmark to distinguish subtle yet critical mechanistic differences, such as changes in protein abundance versus post-translational modifications.

#### Human Expert Verification

To establish a high-confidence gold standard, we perform human-in-the-loop validation. A randomly sampled subset of the constructed knowledge graph entries is reviewed by domain experts in molecular biology and systems biology, who cross-check each entry against the supporting literature to verify its accuracy and grounding.

------

### Phase IV: BIOME-Bench Task Formulation

Based on the curated and validated knowledge representations, BIOME-Bench defines two complementary evaluation tasks.

#### Task A: Biomolecular Interaction Inference

This task evaluates an LLM’s ability to infer precise molecular relationships within a pathway context. Given a pathway $p_i$, a source entity $e_s$ with state $\sigma_s$, a target entity $e_t$ with state $\sigma_t$, and a biological condition $c$, the model is required to predict the correct interaction relation from a finite controlled vocabulary $\mathcal{R}$:

$$
\hat{r} = \arg\max_{r \in \mathcal{R}} P\bigl(r \mid p_i, e_s, \sigma_s, e_t, \sigma_t, c\bigr).
$$

#### Task B: Multi-Omics Pathway Mechanism Elucidation

This task simulates realistic omics-driven pathway analysis scenarios. The model is provided with a pathway context $p_i$ and a set of differentially observed entities

$$
E_{\text{diff}} \subseteq E_{\text{std}},
$$

and is required to generate a coherent mechanistic explanation $\hat{Y}$ that elucidates the biological interactions, regulatory relationships, and molecular processes connecting these entities within the given pathway context.

BIOME-Bench is a multi-species benchmark that covers three commonly used organisms: hsa (human), mmu (mouse), and rno (rat). The table above summarizes the core statistics, including the numbers of curated pathways, standardized entities, process and phenotype terms, mechanism analysis instances, and knowledge graph relations. Overall, it includes 1347 instances for  multi-omics mechanism elucidation and 11578 instances  for biomolecular interaction inference, both evaluated under consistent pathway contexts.

## 🧩 Evaluation Protocol and Metrics

### Task A: Biomolecular Interaction Inference

We evaluate relation prediction using **Accuracy** and **Macro-F1**.

### Task B: Multi-Omics Pathway Mechanism Elucidation

For generated explanations, we adopt a multi-dimensional evaluation strategy:

1. **LLM-as-a-Judge**: We use **Qwen3-32B** as the judge model. Given the ground-truth mechanism text $M_{\text{text}}$, it scores the generated explanation $\hat{Y}$ on four dimensions (1–5): **Phenotype Coverage**, **Causal Reasoning**, **Factuality**, and **Hallucination Control**.

2. **Structured Knowledge Evaluation**: Based on the literature-derived knowledge graph, we adopt a closed-set protocol. We use **Qwen3-32B** as the extractor model and only allow tuples selected from the standardized knowledge graph to support $\hat{Y}$, ensuring $\mathcal{T}_{\text{pred}}\subseteq\mathcal{T}_{\text{GT}}$ . Factual completeness is measured via **Coverage**:

$$
\text{Coverage} = \frac{|\mathcal{T}_{\text{pred}}|}{|\mathcal{T}_{\text{GT}}|}
$$

3. **Semantic Embedding Similarity**: We compute cosine similarity between vector embeddings of $\hat{Y}$ and the reference mechanism text $M_{\text{text}}$.

These results indicate that models tend to collapse fine-grained biological mechanisms into coarse causal or regulatory relations (e.g., `leads_to`) and struggle to distinguish direct regulation from pathway-level causation. Over-interpretation of underspecified relations (e.g., polarizing `regulates`) and limited fine-grained discrimination reflect current models’ limitations in handling complex biological logic.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Environment Setup

Make sure Python 3.10+ is installed.

```bash
# 克隆仓库
git clone url
cd BIOME-Bench

# 安装依赖
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Configuration (`config/config.json`)

Before running, you **must** configure the model endpoints. Below is a complete configuration example, including the evaluated model, judge model, and embedding model:

```json
{
  "EvalModel": {
    "api_config": {
      "model": "EvalModel",
      "base_url": "http://localhost:8000/v1",
      "api_key": "EMPTY",
      "timeout": 60,
      "max_retries": 10
    },
    "generation_config": {
      "temperature": 0.0,
      "max_tokens": 10240,
      "no_think": false,
      "thinking_rules_file": "config/thinking_rules.json"
    },
    "save_every": 10
  },
  "JudgeModel": {
    "api_config": {
      "model": "Qwen3-32B",
      "base_url": "http://localhost:8001/v1",
      "api_key": "sk-..."
    },
    "generation_config": {
      "max_tokens": 10240,
      "temperature": 0.0
    }
  },
  "EmbedModel": {
    "api_config": {
      "model": "Qwen3-8B-Embedding",
      "base_url": "http://localhost:8002/v1",
      "api_key": "sk-..."
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Run the Demo (One Command)

Use the example data in `data/` to quickly validate the pipeline:

```bash
# Run Demo (quick validation using a one-example test set)
python run_demo.py --threads 1
```

### 4. Run the Full Evaluation (One Command)

```bash
# Run the full evaluation (full dataset with a specified config)
python run_pipeline.py --config config/my_config.json --threads 1
```

## 🛠️ Manual Pipeline

### Stage 1: Model Inference

Use the `evaluation` module to run batch inference on the dataset.

```bash
# Task-A
python -m evaluation run \
  --data data/TASK-A.jsonl \
  --task-type relation_prediction \
  --config config/config.json \
  --threads 1

# Task-B
python -m evaluation run \
  --data data/TASK-B.jsonl \
  --task-type mechanism_analysis \
  --config config/config.json \
  --threads 1
```

If your endpoint supports high-concurrency inference, increase `threads` to speed up evaluation.

### Stage 2: Scoring and Metric Computation

#### 1. Task A: Relation Prediction Accuracy

```bash
python metrics/biomolecular_interaction_inference_acc.py \
  --input outputs/your_run/results.jsonl
```

#### 2. Task B: Mechanism Analysis (LLM-as-a-Judge)

**Note**: You must provide species-specific knowledgebase files via `--db`.

```bash
python metrics/LLM-as-a-Judge.py \
  --results outputs/your_run/results.jsonl \
  --db data/hsa.jsonl data/mmu.jsonl data/rno.jsonl \
  --output outputs/your_run/judge_results.jsonl \
  --threads 1
```

## 🧠 Advanced Features

### Thinking Rules (`config/thinking_rules.json`)

Special handling for reasoning models (e.g., Qwen3), supporting dynamic injection of prompt prefixes.

### Resume & Recovery

The framework automatically creates `checkpoint.json` in the run directory. If execution is interrupted, rerun the same command or use `--resume-run-id` to resume progress.

The majority of urothelial carcinoma are bladder carcinomas, and urothelial carcinomas of the renal pelvis and ureter account for only approximately 7% of the total. Urothelial tumours arise and evolve through divergent phenotypic pathways. Some tumours progress from urothelial hyperplasia to low-grade non-invasive superficial papillary tumours. More aggressive variants arise either from flat, high-grade carcinoma in situ (CIS) and progress to invasive tumours, or they arise de novo as invasive tumours. Low-grade papillary tumors frequently show a constitutive activation of the receptor tyrosine kinase-Ras pathway, exhibiting activating mutations in the HRAS and fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) genes. In contrast, CIS and invasive tumors frequently show alterations in the TP53 and RB genes and pathways. Invasion and metastases are promoted by several factors that alter the tumour microenvironment, including the aberrant expression of E-cadherins (E-cad), matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).",

Results: SIGLEC12 expression was higher in both low-grade papillary and high-grade invasive non-papillary BCa. Higher SIGLEC12 expression resulting from low promoter hypomethylation was detected at the stage II-IV of BCa, and was unrelated to disease stages and metastatic stages. Elevated SIGLEC12 expression correlated with increased immune cell infiltration, higher expression of oncogenic and immune checkpoint blockade-related genes, and drug resistance signatures. Mutation analysis confirmed the absence of the canonical R122 missense mutation, indicating that the structural integrity and potential functionality of Siglec-XII are preserved in BCa. Conclusions: SIGLEC12 may have sialic acid recognition functions and serve as a potential early biomarker of BCa.",

This gene is present in a gene cluster with other members of the cadherin family on chromosome 16. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2015].",
